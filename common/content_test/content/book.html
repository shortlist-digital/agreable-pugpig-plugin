<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND WONDERLAND ALICE</span></h2>

<p>Once upon a time, after Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the nice bunny rabbit gentleman,
had some funny adventures with Baby
Bunty, and when he found that his rheumatism
did not hurt him so much as he hopped
on his red, white and blue striped barber pole
crutch, the bunny uncle wished he might
have some strange and wonderful adventures.</p>

<p>"I think I'll just hop along and look for a
few," said Uncle Wiggily to himself one
morning. He twinkled his pink nose, and
then he was all ready to start.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Nurse Jane! Good-bye!" he
called to his muskrat lady housekeeper, with
whom he lived in a hollow stump bungalow.
"I'm going to look for some wonderful
adventures!" He hopped down the front
steps, with his red, white and blue striped
crutch under one paw, and his tall, silk hat
on his head. "Good-bye, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" answered Nurse Jane. "I hope
you have some nice adventures!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thanks, I wish you the same," answered
Uncle Wiggily, and away he went over the
fields and through the woods. He had not
hopped very far, looking this way and that,
before, all of a sudden, he came to a queer
little place, near an old rail fence. Down in
one corner was a hole, partly underground.</p>

<p>"Ha! That's queer," said Uncle Wiggily to
himself. "That looks just like the kind of an
underground house, or burrow, where I used
to live. I wonder if this can be where I made
my home before I moved to the hollow stump
bungalow? I must take a look. Nurse Jane
would like to hear all about it."</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily, folding back his ears in
order that they would not get bent over and
broken, began crawling down the rabbit hole,
for that is what it really was.</p>

<p>It was dark inside, but the bunny uncle did
not mind that, being able to see in the dark.
Besides, he could make his pink nose twinkle
when he wanted to, and this gave almost as
much light as a firefly.</p>

<p>"No, this isn't the burrow where I used to
live," said Uncle Wiggily to himself, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
had hopped quite a distance into the hole.
"But it's very nice. Perhaps I may have an
adventure here. Who knows?"</p>

<p>And just as he said that to himself, Uncle
Wiggily saw, lying under a little table, in
what seemed to be a room of the underground
house, a small glass box.</p>

<p>"Ha! My adventure begins!" cried Uncle
Wiggily. "I'll open that glass box and see
what is in it."</p>

<p>So the bunny uncle raised the cover, and in
the glass box was a little cake, made of carrots
and cabbage, and on top, spelled out in
pink raisins, were the words:</p>

<p class="center big">"EAT ME!"</p>

<p>"Ha! That's just what I'll do!" cried jolly
Uncle Wiggily, and, never stopping to think
anything might be wrong, the bunny gentleman
ate the cake. And then, all of a sudden,
he began to feel very funny.</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. "I
hope that cake didn't belong to my nephew,
Sammie Littletail, or Johnnie or Billie Bushytail,
the squirrel brothers. One of them may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
have lost it out of his lunch basket on his way
to school. I hope it wasn't any of their cake.
But there is surely something funny about it,
for I feel so very queer!"</p>

<p>And no wonder! For Uncle Wiggily had
suddenly begun to grow very large. His ears
grew taller, so that they lifted his tall silk hat
right off his head. His legs seemed as long
as bean poles, and as for his whiskers and
pink, twinkling nose, they seemed so far
away from his eyes that he wondered if he
would ever get them near enough to see to
comb the one, or scratch the other when it felt
ticklish.</p>

<p>"This is certainly remarkable!" cried
Uncle Wiggily. "I wonder what made me
grow so large all of a sudden? Could it have
been the cake which gave me the indyspepsia?"</p>

<p>"It was the cake!" cried a sudden and buzzing
voice, and, looking around the hole
Uncle Wiggily saw a big mosquito. "It was
the cake that made you grow big," went on
the bad biting bug, "and I put it here for you
to eat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"What for?" asked the bunny uncle, puzzled
like.</p>

<p>"So you would grow so big that you
couldn't get out of this hole," was the answer.
"And now you can't! This is how I have
caught you! Ha! Ha!" and the mosquito
buzzed a most unpleasant laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" thought Uncle Wiggily. "I
wonder if I am caught? Can't I get out as I
got in?"</p>

<p>Quickly he hopped to the front of the hole.
But alas! Likewise sorrowfulness! He had
grown so big from eating the magical cake
that he could not possibly squeeze out of the
hole through which he had crawled into the
underground burrow.</p>

<p>"Now I have caught you!" cried the mosquito.
"Since we could not catch you at your
soldier tent or in the trenches near your hollow
stump bungalow, I thought of this way.
Now we have you and we'll bite you!" and the
big mosquito, who with his bad friends had
dug the hole on purpose to get Uncle Wiggily
in a trap, began to play a bugle tune on his
wings to call the other biting bugs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" thought Uncle Wiggily. "I
guess I am caught! And I haven't my talcum
powder pop gun that shoots bean-bag bullets!
Oh, if I could only get out of here!"</p>

<p>"You can get out, Uncle Wiggily," said a
soft little voice down toward the end of his
pink, twinkling nose. "You can get out!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I can't!" the bunny said. "I am
much too large to squeeze out of the hole by
which I came in here. Much too large. Oh,
dear!"</p>

<p>"Here, drink some of this and you'll grow
small just as I did when I drank from it before
I fell into the pool of tears," the soft and
gentle voice went on, and to Uncle Wiggily's
surprise, there stood a nice little girl with
long, flaxen hair. She was holding out to
him a bottle with a tag that read:</p>

<p class="center big">"DRINK ME."</p>

<p>"Am I really to drink this?" asked the
bunny.</p>

<p>"You are," said the little girl.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily took a long drink from the
bottle. It tasted like lollypop ice cream soda,
and no sooner had he taken a good sip than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
all of a sudden he found himself shutting up
small, like a telescope. Smaller and smaller
he shrank, until he was his own regular size,
and then the little girl took him by the paw
and cried:</p>

<p>"Come on! Now you can get out!"</p>

<p>And, surely enough, Uncle Wiggily could.</p>

<p>"But who are you?" he asked the little girl.</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm Alice from Wonderland," she
said, "and I know you very well, though you
never met me before. I'm in a book, but this
is my holiday, so I came out. Come on, now,
before the mosquitoes catch us! We'll have
a lot of funny adventures with some friends
of mine. Come on!" And away ran Uncle
Wiggily with Wonderland Alice, who had
saved him from being bitten. So everything
came out all right, you see.</p>

<p>And if the teacup doesn't lose its handle
and try to do a foxtrot waltz with the soup
tureen, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily

<p>"Well, Uncle Wiggily, you certainly did
have quite a time, didn't you," said Nurse
Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper
for the rabbit gentleman as they both
sat on the porch of the hollow stump bungalow
one morning. It was the day after the
bunny rabbit had been caught in the mosquito
hole, where he swelled up too big to get
out, after eating cake from the glass box, as
I told you in the first story.</p>

<p>Then Alice from Wonderland happened
along and gave Uncle Wiggily a drink from a
magical little bottle so that he grew small
enough to crawl out of the hole again.</p>

<p>"Yes, I had a wonderful time with Alice,"
said the rabbit gentleman. "It was quite an
adventure."</p>

<p>"What do you s'pose was in the cake to
make you swell up so large?" asked Nurse
Jane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cream puffs," answered Uncle Wiggily.
"They're very swell-like, you know."</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed Nurse Jane. "And
what was in the bottle to make you grow
smaller?"</p>

<p>"Alum water," Uncle Wiggily made reply.
"That's very shrinking, you know, and puckery."</p>

<p>"Of course," spoke Nurse Jane again, "I
might have guessed it. Now I suppose you're
off again?"</p>

<p>"Off to have another adventure," went on
Uncle Wiggily, with a jolly laugh. "I hope I
meet Alice again. I wonder where she
lives?"</p>

<p>"Why, she's out of a book," said Nurse
Jane. "I used to read about her to Sammie
Littletail, when he was quite a little rabbit
chap."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, to be sure," said Uncle Wiggily.
"Alice from Wonderland is like Mother
Goose, Sinbad the Sailor and my other Arabian
Night friends. Well, I hope I meet some
of them and have another adventure now,"
and away he hopped down the front steps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
his bungalow as spry as though he never had
had the rheumatism.</p>

<p>The bad mosquitoes that used to live over
in the swamp had gone away on their summer
vacation, and so they did not bother the
bunny rabbit just at present. He no longer
had to practice being a soldier and stand on
guard against them.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, as Uncle Wiggily hopped
along, he came to a little place in the woods,
all set around with green trees, and in the
center was a large doll's tea table, all ready
for a meal.</p>

<p>"Ha! This looks like an adventure already!"
said the bunny uncle to himself.
"And there's a party," he went on, as he saw
the little girl named Alice, a March Hare
(which is a sort of spring rabbit), a hatter
man, with a very large hat, much larger than
Uncle Wiggily's, on his head, and a dormouse.
A dormouse (or doormouse) is one
that crawls out under a door, you know, to
get away from the cat.</p>

<p>"Oh, here's Uncle Wiggily!" cried Alice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come right along and sit down. We didn't
expect you!"</p>

<p>"Then if I'm unexpected, perhaps there
isn't room for me," spoke Uncle Wiggily,
looking at the March Hare.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there's plenty of room&mdash;more
room than there is to eat," said the spring
rabbit. "Besides, we really knew you were
coming."</p>

<p>As this was just different from what Alice
had said, Uncle Wiggily did not know what to
believe.</p>

<p>"You see, it's the unexpected that always
happens," went on the March Hare, "and, of
course, being unexpected, you happened
along, so we're glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Only there isn't anything to eat," said
Alice. "You see, the Hatter's watch only
keeps one kind of time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's what I do when I dance," interrupted
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"We haven't come to that yet," Alice spoke
gently. "But as the Hatter's watch only
keeps tea-time we're always at the tea table,
and the cake and tea were eaten long ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"And we always have to sit here, hoping
the Hatter's watch will start off again, and
bring us to breakfast or dinner on time,"
said the March Hare, who, Uncle Wiggily
noticed, began to look rather mad and angry.
"He's greased it with the best butter, but still
his watch has stopped," the hare added.</p>

<p>"It's on account of the hard crumbs that
got in the wheels," said the Hatter, dipping
his watch in the cream pitcher. "I dare say
they'll get soaked in time. But pass Uncle
Wiggily the buns," he added, and Alice
passed an empty plate which once had dog
biscuits on, only Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow
had eaten them all up&mdash;I should say down,
for they swallowed them that way.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily was beginning to think this
was a very queer tea party indeed, when, all
of sudden, out from the bushes jumped a
great, big, pink-striped Wabberjocky cat,
who began singing:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"London Bridge is falling up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On Yankee Doodle Dandy!</span><br />
As we go 'round the mulberry bush<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To buy a stick of candy."</span>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" asked the Mad
March Hare of the Wabberjocky. "If you've
come to wash the dishes you can't, for it's still
tea time and it never will be anything else as
long as he keeps dipping his watch in the molasses
jug! That's what makes it so sticky-slow,"
and he tossed a tea biscuit at the Hatter,
who caught it in his hat, just like a magician
in the theater, and turned it into a lemon
meringue pie.</p>

<p>"I've come for Uncle Wiggily!" cried the
Wabberjocky. "I've come to take him off to
my den, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily was just going to hide under
the table, which he noticed was growing
smaller and smaller, and he was wondering
if it would be large enough to cover him,
when&mdash;</p>

<p>All of a sudden the Mad March Hare
caught up the bunny uncle's red, white and
blue striped rheumatism crutch, and cried:</p>

<p>"You've come for Uncle Wiggily, have
you? Well, we've no time for that!" and with
this the March Hare smashed the crutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
down on the Hatter's watch, "Bang!" breaking
it all to pieces!</p>

<p>"There, I guess it'll go now!" cried the
March Hare, and indeed the wheels of the
watch went spinning while the spring suddenly
uncurled, and one end, catching around
Uncle Wiggily's left hind leg, flew out and
tossed him safely away over the trees, until
he fell down on his soft soldier tent, right in
front of his own hollow stump bungalow. So
he was saved from the Wabberjocky.</p>

<p>"Well! That was an adventure!" cried the
bunny uncle. "I wonder what happened to
the rest of them? I must find out." And if
the laundry man doesn't let the plumber take
the bath tub away for the gold fish to play tag
in, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
the Cheshire Cat.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CHESHIRE CAT</span></h2>


<p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
was hopping along through the woods
one day, wondering what sort of an adventure
he would have, and he was thinking
about Alice in Wonderland and what a queer
tea party he had been to the day before,
when the Mad March Hare smashed the Hatter's
watch because the hands always stayed
at 5 o'clock tea time.</p>

<p>"If anything like that is going to happen
to me today," said the bunny uncle to himself,
"I ought to have brought Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy along, so she could enjoy the fun. I'll
just hop along and if anything queer starts
I'll go back after her."</p>

<p>So he went on a little farther, and, all of a
sudden, he saw, lying on the woodland path,
a piece of cheese.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried Uncle Wiggily. "I wonder if
Jollie or Jillie Longtail, the mouse children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
dropped that out of their trap? I'll take it to
them, I guess."</p>

<p>He picked up the bit of cheese, thinking
how glad the mousie boy and girl would be to
have it back, when, all at once, he heard behind
him a voice asking:</p>

<p>"Oh, did you find it? I'm so glad, thank
you!" and from under a bush out stepped a
cat wearing a large smile on the front of its
face. The cat stretched out its claw and took
the bit of cheese from Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Oh! Is that yours?" asked the bunny gentleman,
in surprise.</p>

<p>"It's Cheshire cheese; isn't it?" asked the
cat.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I believe so," answered the bunny.
"Yes," he added as he looked and made sure,
"it is Cheshire cheese."</p>

<p>"Then, as I'm the Cheshire cat it's mine.
Cheshire cat meet your cheese! Cheese, meet
your cat! How do you do? So glad to see
you!" and the cat shook paws with the cheese
just as if Uncle Wiggily had introduced
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"I dare say it's all right," went on the
bunny uncle.</p>

<p>"Of course it is!" laughed the cat, smiling
more than ever. "I'm so glad you found my
cheese. I was afraid the March Hare had
taken it for that silly 5 o'clock tea party. But
I'm glad he didn't. At first I took you for the
March Hare. You look like him, being a
rabbit."</p>

<p>"My birthday is not in March, it is in
April," said Uncle Wiggily, bowing.</p>

<p>"That's better," spoke the Cheshire cat.
"You have done me a great favor by finding
my cheese, and I hope to be able to do you one
some day."</p>

<p>"Pray do not mention it," spoke the bunny
uncle, modest-like and shy, as he always was.
He was just going to ask about Alice in
Wonderland when the cat ran away with the
cheese.</p>

<p>"Never mind," thought Uncle Wiggily.
"That was the beginning of an adventure,
anyhow. I wonder what the next part will
be?" He did not have long to wait.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, as he was walking along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
through the woods, sort of leaning on his red,
white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism
crutch, there was a rustling in the
bushes and out popped a whole lot of hungry
rats.</p>

<p>"Ah, there IT is!" cried one rat, seizing hold
of Uncle Wiggily by his ears.</p>

<p>"Yes, and just in time, too!" cried another,
grabbing the bunny by his paws. "Into our
den with IT before the mouse trap comes
along and takes IT away from us!"</p>

<p>With that the rats, of which there were
about five hundred and sixteen, began hustling
Uncle Wiggily down a hole in the ground,
and the first he knew they had him inside a
wooden room in an underground house and
they locked the door, taking the key out.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" cried the bunny
uncle. "Why do you treat me this way?"</p>

<p>"Why, IT can speak!" cried several of the
rats, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Of course I can!" cried Uncle Wiggily, his
pink nose twinkling. "But why do you call
me IT?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because you are a piece of cheese," said
one rat, "and we always call cheese IT."</p>

<p>"Cheese? I, cheese?" asked astonished
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Of course," cried the biggest rat of all.
"You're Cheshire cheese. Why, you perfume
the whole room! We're so hungry for you.
We thought the grocer had forgotten to send
you. But it's all right now. Oh, what a
delightful meal we shall have. We love
Cheshire cheese," and the rats in the room
with Mr. Longears looked very hungrily at
the bunny uncle&mdash;very hungrily indeed.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do?" thought Uncle
Wiggily. "I see what has happened. When
I picked up the Cheshire cat's piece of
Cheshire cheese some of the perfume from it
must have stuck to my paws. The rats
smelled that and think I'm it. IT!" murmured
the bunny gentleman. "As if I were
a game of tag! IT!"</p>

<p>The rats in the locked room were very busy,
getting out their cheese knives and plates,
and poor Uncle Wiggily hardly knew what to
do with this most unpleasant adventure happening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to him, when, all of a sudden, right in
the middle of the room, there appeared a big,
smiling mouth, with a cheerful grin spread
all over it. Just a smile it was, and nothing
more.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Uncle Wiggily in surprise.
"Oh!"</p>

<p>With that all the rats looked up and, seeing
the smile, one exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I smell a cat! Oh, woe is me! I smell a
cat!"</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden the smile grew larger
and larger. Then a nose seemed to grow out
of nothing, then some whiskers, then a pair
of blazing eyes, and then ears&mdash;a head, legs,
claws and a body, and finally there stood the
Cheshire cat in the midst of the rats.</p>

<p>"Scat, rats," meaouwed the Cheshire cat.
"Scat!"</p>

<p>"How did you get in here?" asked one rat.</p>

<p>"Yes, tell us!" ordered another. "How did
you get in past the locked door?"</p>

<p>"Through the keyhole," said the Cheshire
cat. "I sent my smile in first, and then it was
easy for my body to follow. Now you scat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and leave Uncle Wiggily alone!" and with
that the cat grinned larger than ever, showing
such sharp teeth that the rats quickly unlocked
the door and ran away, leaving the
bunny uncle quite safe.</p>

<p>"Alice in Wonderland, most magically
knew of the trouble you were in," said the
Cheshire cat, "so she sent me to help you,
which I was glad to do, as you had helped me.
My Cheshire cheese, that you found for me
when I had lost it, was very good!"</p>

<p>Then Uncle Wiggily hopped back to his
bungalow, and the cat went to see Alice; and
if the paper cutter doesn't slice the bread
board all up into pieces of cake for the puppy
dog's party, I'll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the Dormouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE DORMOUSE</span></h2>


<p>"Tap! Tap! Tap!" came a knock on the
door of the hollow stump bungalow one
morning. Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit
gentleman who lived in the woods, called
out:</p>

<p>"Please come in!"</p>

<p>In hopped Dickie Chip-Chip, the sparrow
boy postchap, with a letter for the bunny
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Ha! That's nice!" explained Uncle Wiggily
as he took the envelope. "I hope it's a
valentine!"</p>

<p>"A valentine this time of year!" laughed
Dickie. "This is June, Uncle Wiggily!"</p>

<p>"Oh, so it is. However, I'll read it." And
when Dickie flew on to deliver the rest of his
letters Uncle Wiggily read his own. It was
very short, and said:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"If you want a new hat, come to the
green meadow as soon as you read this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ha! If I want a new hat!" thought the
bunny uncle. "Well, I do need one. But who
knew that I did? This is very strange and
mysterious. Ha! I have it! This must be
from Alice in Wonderland. She is giving me
a little surprise."</p>

<p>So, telling Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, his
muskrat lady housekeeper, that he was going
out to get a new hat, away hopped Uncle
Wiggily, over the fields and through the
woods until he came to the green meadow.</p>

<p>In the middle of the meadow was a little
grove of trees, and half way there Uncle
Wiggily heard a sad little voice saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! What trouble I'm in!"</p>

<p>"Trouble!" cried the bunny gentleman
twinkling his pink nose. "Ha! That sounds
like old times! Let me help some one. But
who is it?"</p>

<p>"It is I. The little Dormouse," was the answer,
and, looking down, Uncle Wiggily saw
the tiny creature who had been at the queer
tea party when the Mad March Hare smashed
the Hatter's 5 o'clock watch.</p>

<p>The tail of the poor little Dormouse was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
caught fast in between two stones and she
could not move, but Uncle Wiggily quickly
loosened it for her and she was very thankful
to get out.</p>

<p>"I was afraid I'd be late," said the Dormouse.
"I have to hurry on to help the Queen
of Hearts put sugared cheese on the blackberry
tarts for the King's birthday. I'll see
you again, Uncle Wiggily."</p>

<p>"I hope so," spoke the bunny uncle, as he
hurried away to get his new hat, all the while
wondering whether or not he would see Alice
from Wonderland.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily reached the green meadow
trees, but no one else was there. He looked
up and down, and all around, but there was
not even an old hat in sight, to say nothing of
a new one.</p>

<p>"I wonder if this letter is an April fool
joke?" thought the bunny uncle, taking from
his pocket the envelope Dickie had given
him. "No, if it's the month of June it can't
be April Fool's Day, any more than it can be
time for valentines," said the bunny. "But I
wonder where my hat is?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly had Uncle Wiggily said this, out
loud, than, all of a sudden, a voice cried:</p>

<p>"Here's your hat!"</p>

<p>With that something seemed to drop down
from the clouds, or maybe it was from one of
the trees. But whatever it was it completely
covered Uncle Wiggily out of sight. It was
just as if you took a large bowl and turned it
upside down over a grasshopper, only, of
course, Uncle Wiggily was not a grasshopper,
though he did jump around a lot.</p>

<p>And, at first, in the sudden darkness, the
rabbit gentleman thought it was a bowl that,
perhaps, the circus elephant's little boy had
turned over on him just for fun.</p>

<p>Then, making his pink nose twinkle very
fast, so that it shone in the dark like a firefly
lantern, Uncle Wiggily was able to see that
he was inside a large, tall, silk hat. When it
had dropped over him it had shut out all the
sunlight, making it quite dark inside where
the bunny was.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is a hat!" said Uncle Wiggily to
himself. "But what a funny way to give it to
me! And it's so large! Instead of my new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
hat going outside my head, my head is inside
the hat. This will never do! I must get out
and see what the trouble is. This must be the
elephant's hat, it's so large."</p>

<p>But when Uncle Wiggily tried to lift up one
edge of the hat, to crawl out, he found he
could not. Some one seemed to be sitting on
top of the hat, which was shaped like the silk
stovepipe one Uncle Wiggily always wore.
And a voice cried:</p>

<p>"Hold it tight and he can't get out!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm holding it tight!" was the answer.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Wiggily knew what had happened.
Some one had played a sad trick on
him. And it was two bad old skillery-scalery
alligators. They had borrowed the Wonderland
Hatter's hat&mdash;which was very large.
Nor had they told the Hatter what they
wanted of it, for if they had he never would
have let them borrow it to make trouble for
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>The alligators had climbed up the tree with
the big hat, and, after sending Uncle Wiggily
the note, they had waited until he came to the
field. Then from the branches above they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
dropped the hat down over him and sat on it.</p>

<p>"And I can't get out!" cried Uncle Wiggily.
"That's the worst of it! I can't get out,
and those bad alligators will reach under and
grab me and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No they won't!" cried a little squeaky
voice down low on the ground, just outside
the hat.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Uncle Wiggily, hopeful
like.</p>

<p>"Because I am the Dormouse whom you
helped," was the answer. "Now, listen!
With my sharp teeth I am going to cut a door
in the side of the hat where the alligators,
sitting up on top, can't see it. Then you can
get out."</p>

<p>So the Dormouse, being made for just such
work, as you can tell by its name, gnawed a
door in the side of the Hatter's hat, and out
crawled the bunny rabbit gentleman before
the alligators could grab him. And the bunny
and the Dormouse got safely away, Mr. Longears
being very thankful, indeed, for having
been helped by the little creature.</p>

<p>So the alligators had nothing for dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
but stewed pears, and if our dog doesn't leave
his tail on the wrong side of the fence, so the
cat can use it for a dusting brush, I'll tell you
next about Uncle Wiggily and the Gryphon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE GRYPHON</span></h2>


<p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice rabbit
gentleman, had just finished shaving his
whiskers in his hollow stump bungalow one
morning when Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, his
muskrat lady housekeeper, came to his door,
knocked gently by flapping her tail against
it, and said:</p>

<p>"If you please, Mr. Longears, there's a
young lady to see you."</p>

<p>"Of course I'm pleased," answered Uncle
Wiggily. "I always like to see young ladies,
especially if they have light, fluffy hair. Has
this one that kind?"</p>

<p>"Very much so," answered Nurse Jane.
"Here she is now," and with that in came a
nice young lady, or, rather, a tall girl, with
flaxen hair.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you don't remember me," she
said, as Uncle Wiggily wiped the soap lather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
off the end of his pink, twinkling nose, where
it had splashed by mistake, making it look
like part of a frosted chocolate cake.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do remember you!" cried the
bunny gentleman, in his most jolly voice.
"You're Alice from Wonderland, and you
were very kind to help me grow smaller that
time the big mosquito got me into his cave
and I swelled up from eating cake."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad you remember me!"
laughed Alice, for it was indeed she. "I've
come to ask you to do me a bit of a favor. I
have to go see the Gryphon, and I thought
maybe you'd come with me, for I'm afraid
he'll be real cross to me."</p>

<p>"You have to go see the Gryphon?" exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily. "Who in the world
is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a funny animal who lives in the
same story book with me," explained Alice.
"He's something between a dragon, a lion, an
elephant, a flying fish and an alligator."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Uncle Wiggily. "He
must be a curious creature!"</p>

<p>"He is," Alice said. "And sometimes he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
very cross, especially if the wind blows his
veil up."</p>

<p>"If the wind blows his veil up?" asked
Uncle Wiggily. "In the first place, why does
he wear a veil, and in the second place, why
should he be angry if the wind blows it?"</p>

<p>"There isn't any first or second place about
it," spoke Alice, "for you never can tell in
which place the Gryphon will be found. But
he wears a veil because he is so ugly that
every one runs away when one sees him, and
he doesn't like that. And, of course, he
doesn't like the wind to blow up his veil so
folks can see how he really looks."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! I understand," remarked the
bunny. "But if he is so cross why do you want
to go to see him?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to," replied Alice, "but I have
to, because it's that way in the book. You
see, to make everything come out right, the
Gryphon takes me to the Mock Turtle, who
tells me a funny story, and so now I've come
to see if you'll take me to the Gryphon?"</p>

<p>"I will," promised Uncle Wiggily, washing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the soap lather out of his ears. "But where
shall we find him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the question!" laughed Alice,
just as though Uncle Wiggily had asked a
riddle. "You have three guesses," she went
on.</p>

<p>The bunny gentleman twinkled his pink
nose, so that he might think better, and then
he said:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll go for a
walk, and make believe I'm looking for an
adventure. Then I may find the Gryphon for
you."</p>

<p>"Fine!" cried Alice, and, Uncle Wiggily
having finished shaving, he and Alice set out
together over the fields and through the
wood, her hand holding the bunny's paw.</p>

<p>"Now we must keep a sharp watch for the
Gryphon," said Alice, who had had so many
adventures in Wonderland that it took a
whole book to tell of them. "You never
know whether he'll appear like an elephant,
a dragon, a lion or a big bird, for he has
wings," she said.</p>

<p>"Has he, indeed?" asked Uncle Wiggily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
"Then I think I hear him coming now," he
went on. "Listen, do you hear the buzzing?"
And, surely enough, the air seemed filled
with the buzzing and fluttering of wings.
And then the sun appeared to be hidden by
a cloud.</p>

<p>"That must be the Gryphon," said Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>Alice looked, and then she cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, no! It's a big cloud of bad, biting
mosquitoes. It is the buzzing of their wings
we hear! Oh, Uncle Wiggily, you haven't
your talcum powder bean-shooter gun with
you, and here come a billion-million mosquitoes!"</p>

<p>"That's right!" cried the bunny uncle, as
he, too, saw them. "We must hide or they will
bite even our shoes off!"</p>

<p>So he and Alice looked for a place to hide,
but there was none, and the buzzing mosquitoes
cried:</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! Now we have that Uncle Wiggily
Longears rabbit. He can't get away
now, for he isn't a soldier today! And we'll
get Alice from Wonderland, too!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, the mosquitoes were just going to
grab the bunny gentleman, and the nice little
young lady girl, with the fluffy flaxen hair,
when a voice out of the air cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! No you're not going to get them,
either!"</p>

<p>"Who says we are not?" asked the captain
mosquito.</p>

<p>"I do!"</p>

<p>"And who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am the Gryphon!" was the answer. "And
I have on my mosquito net veil. I'll catch all
you bad biting bugs in my net, just as a professor
catches butterflies. Whoop! Swoop!
Here I come!"</p>

<p>And with that the Gryphon, raising his
veil, which hung down from his big ears as
from around a lady's big hat, made a net of
it and, flying around, soon caught all the
mosquitoes that would have bitten Uncle
Wiggily and Alice.</p>

</div>

<p>And the mosquitoes that were not caught
were so frightened at the fierce look on the
Gryphon's face that they fainted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
couldn't bite even as much as a spoonful of
mustard.</p>

<p>So the Gryphon drove the mosquitoes
away and then he took Alice to see the Mock
Turtle, while Uncle Wiggily hopped on home
to his bungalow. And if the rubber doll
doesn't bounce off the clothes horse when she
rides to the candy store for some cornstarch
pudding, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and the blue caterpillar.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CATERPILLAR</span></h2>


<p>"Uncle Wiggily! Oh, Uncle Wiggily!"
called Alice from Wonderland as she stood
one day just outside the hollow stump bungalow
where the rabbit gentleman had just
finished his breakfast of carrot oatmeal with
parsnip sauce sprinkled over the top.</p>

<p>"Do you want to come for another walk
with me?" asked Alice as she ran up the bungalow
front steps.</p>

<p>"Are you going to have the Gryphon take
you to the Mock Turtle again?" the bunny
gentleman wanted to know. "If you are, I'll
bring my talcum powder gun along this time,
to keep away the mosquitoes."</p>

<p>"No. I don't have to see the Gryphon today,"
replied Wonderland Alice with a laugh.
"But the Duchess has sent me to find the
Blue Caterpillar."</p>

<p>"The Duchess has sent you to find the Blue
Caterpillar?" questioned Uncle Wiggily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
wondering if he had heard rightly. "But
who is the Duchess?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's some relation to the Queen of
Hearts," Alice answered. "She's in the book
with me, the Duchess is. In the book-picture
she always has a lot of trimming on her big
hat, and she doesn't care whether or not she
holds the baby upside down."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, now I remember," Uncle Wiggily
said, laughing as he thought of the baby.
"And now about the Blue Caterpillar?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a sort of long, fuzzy bug, who sits
on a toadstool smoking a pipe," explained
Alice. "The Duchess wants him to come and
smoke some hams for her."</p>

<p>"Smoke hams!" cried the bunny rabbit.
"Why the very idonical idea! I've heard of
men smoking tobacco&mdash;but hams&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't smoke hams in a pipe," said
Alice with a laugh. "They take a ham before
it is cooked, and hang it up in a cloud of
smoke, or blow smoke on it, or do something
to it with smoke, so it will dry and keep
longer."</p>

<p>"What do they want to keep it for?" asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Uncle Wiggily. "I thought ham was to eat,
with eggs."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" laughed Alice. "I wish you
wouldn't ask me so many questions. You're
like the Dormouse, or the Cheshire Cheese
Cat or the Hatter. They were always asking
the curiousestest questions like 'Who threw
stones at the cherry tree?' or 'How did the
soft egg get inside the hard shell without
cracking it?' All things like that. I can't
answer them!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Uncle Wiggily, smiling
at Alice. "I'll not ask you any more questions.
Come on! We'll go find the Blue
Caterpillar."</p>

<p>So off they started, the bunny rabbit gentleman
and Wonderland Alice who had a
day's vacation from the book with her name
on it. Now and then she could slip out of the
book covers and go off to have a real adventure
with Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>The bunny uncle and the little girl with the
pretty, flaxen hair had not gone very far over
the fields and through the woods before, all
of a sudden, as they were walking under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
some trees, something long and twisty and
rubbery, like a big fire hose, reached out and
grabbed them.</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" cried Alice, trying to get loose,
which she could not do. "A big snake has
us!"</p>

<p>"No," said Uncle Wiggily, looking around
as best he could, for he, too, was held fast as
was Alice. "This isn't a snake."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"It's a bad circus elephant," said the bunny,
"and he has caught us in his trunk. Oh,
dear! Please let us go!" he begged the big
animal.</p>

<p>"No," sadly answered the circus elephant,
for it was indeed he. "I can't let you go, for
if I do they will all sit on my back and bite
me."</p>

<p>"Who will?" asked Uncle Wiggily, curious
like.</p>

<p>"The mosquitoes," was the answer. "You
see they have tried in so many ways to catch
you, and haven't done it, Uncle Wiggily, that
they finally came to me. About a million billion
of them swarmed around me, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
said they'd bite me until I had the shiv-ivers
if I did not help them catch you. So I had to
promise that I would, though I did not want
to, for I like you, Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"If I hadn't promised, though, the mosquitoes
would have bitten me, and though I
seem to have a very thick skin I am very
tender, not to say ticklish, when it comes to
mosquito bites. So I hid here to catch you,
and I'll have to hold you until the mosquitoes
come to get you. I'm very sorry!" and the
elephant wound his rubbery nose of a trunk
still more tightly around Uncle Wiggily and
Alice.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" said Alice. "What shall we
do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure," answered the
bunny. "This is quite too bad. If only the
Blue Caterpillar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" exclaimed a fuzzy voice down in
the grass near the elephant's left front foot.
"Don't say a word. I'll help you," and along
came crawling a big Blue Caterpillar, with a
folded toadstool umbrella and a long-stemmed
pipe on his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"That elephant is very ticklish," said the
Blue Caterpillar. "Watch me make him
squirm. And when he squirms he'll have to
uncurl his trunk to scratch himself, and when
he does that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll get away!" whispered Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" said the Blue Caterpillar. So
he crawled up the elephant's leg, and tickled
the big animal on its ear.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" cried the elephant. "How itchy
I am!" and he uncurled his trunk to scratch
himself, and then Uncle Wiggily and Alice
could run away safely, and the mosquitoes
didn't get them after all. Then Alice told the
Blue Caterpillar about the Duchess wanting
the hams smoked and the crawling creature
said he'd attend to it, and puff smoke on them
from his pipe.</p>

<p>So everything came out all right, I'm glad
to say, and if the starch doesn't all come out
of the collar so it has to lie down instead of
standing up straight at the moving picture
show, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and the Hatter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE HATTER</span></h2>


<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily!" called Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper,
as Mr. Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
started to hop out of his hollow stump bungalow
one morning. "Oh, Uncle Wiggily!"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" asked the bunny with a
polite bow. "Do you want anything from the
store?"</p>

<p>"Some carrot coffee, if you please," answered
the muskrat lady. "When you finish
your walk, and have had a nice adventure,
bring home some coffee."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," promised Uncle Wiggily, and
then, as he hopped along, over the fields and
through the woods, he thought perhaps he
had better buy the carrot coffee first.</p>

<p>"For," said he to himself, "I might have
such a funny adventure that I'd forget all
about what Nurse Jane told me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Now you just wait and see what happens,
if you please.</p>

<p>It did not take the bunny long to get the
coffee; the monkey doodle gentleman who
kept the store wrapping it up for him in a
paper that had been twisted around a lollypop
candy.</p>

<p>"It's a bit sticky and sweet," said the monkey
doodle store keeper, speaking of the
lollypop paper, "but that will stop the coffee
from falling out."</p>

<p>"Fine!" laughed Uncle Wiggily, and then
he hopped on to look for an adventure. He
had not gone very far before when, all of a
sudden, he heard a voice saying:</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know what to do about it,
that's all! I never saw such trouble! The
idea of wanting me to get ready for it this
time of day!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Trouble!" thought Uncle Wiggily.
"This is where I come in. What is it you can't
get ready for this time of day, and who are
you?" asked the bunny, for he saw no one.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, is it?" called a voice, and out
from under a mulberry bush stepped a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
man, with such a large hat that it covered him
from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse me," said Uncle Wiggily. "You
are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Hatter! Exactly! You have guessed
it," said the little man, opening a window
which was cut in the side of his hat. The window
was just opposite his face, which was inside,
so he could look out at the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>"I'm the Hatter, from 'Alice in Wonderland,'"
went on the little man. The bunny
hadn't quite really guessed it, though he
might if he had had time.</p>

<p>"And what is the trouble?" asked Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've just been ordered by the Queen
of Hearts to get up a tea party right away
for Alice, who is expected any minute," went
on the Hatter. "And here it is 10 o'clock in
the morning, and the tea's at 5, and I haven't
even started."</p>

<p>"You have lots of time," said Uncle Wiggily.
"Hours and hours."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I haven't the tea!" cried the Hatter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
"Don't mind me, but I'm as mad&mdash;as
mad as&mdash;as lollypops, and there's nothing
madder than them!" he said, sort of grinding
his teeth. This grinding made Uncle Wiggily
think of the coffee in his pocket. So, holding
out the package, he said:</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose this would do, would it?"</p>

<p>"What?" asked the Hatter.</p>

<p>"It's coffee," went on the bunny, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The very thing!" cried the Hatter, who
was now smiling. "It will be just the thing
for the 5 o'clock tea. We'll have it right here&mdash;I'll
set the table," and opening two little
doors lower down in his big hat, he stuck his
arms through them and began brushing off
a broad, flat stump near Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"The stump will do for a table," said the
Hatter. "This is great, Uncle Wiggily!
We'll have tea for Alice after all, and make
things happen as they do in the book. Don't
mind me saying I was as mad as lollypops. I
have to be mad&mdash;make believe, you know&mdash;or
things won't come out right."</p>

<p>"I see," said Uncle Wiggily, remembering
that it was quite stylish to be "as mad as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
hatter," though he never before knew what
it meant. "But you see, my dear sir," the rabbit
went on, "I have only coffee to give you,
and not tea."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," said the Hatter. "I'll
boil it in a cocoanut shell, and it will do her
very well," and with that he took out, from
somewhere inside his hat, half a cocoanut
shell. This he set on top of the stump on a
little three-legged stool, and built a fire under
it.</p>

<p>"But you need water to make coffee&mdash;I
mean tea," said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"I have it!" cried the Hatter, and, picking
up an umbrella plant growing near by, he
squeezed some water from it into the cocoanut
shell kettle.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily poured some of the ground
coffee into the cocoanut shell of umbrella
water, which was now boiling, and then the
bunny exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But we have no sugar!"</p>

<p>"We'll sweeten it with the paper that came
off the lollypop," said the Hatter, tearing off
a bit of it and tossing it into the tea-coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"What about milk?" asked Uncle Wiggily.
"Alice may want cream in her coffee&mdash;I mean
tea."</p>

<p>"Here we are!" cried the Hatter.</p>

<p>With that he picked a leaf from a milkweed
plant growing near the flat stump and from
that he squeezed out some drops of milk into
a cup he made from a Jack-in-the-pulpit
flower.</p>

<p>"Now we're all ready for 5 o'clock tea!"
cried the Hatter, and just then along came
Alice from Wonderland, with the March
Hare, and they sat down to the stump table
with Uncle Wiggily, who happened to have a
piece of cherry pie in his pocket, so they had
a nice little lunch after all. And the carrot
coffee with milkweed cream in it, tasted like
catnip tea, so everything came out all right.</p>

<p>And if the white shoes don't go down in the
coal bin to play with the fire shovel and freeze
their toes so they can't parade on the Board
Walk, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and the Duchess.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE DUCHESS</span></h2>


<p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
was hopping along through the
woods one day, looking for an adventure,
when, all of a sudden, he came to a door
standing up between two trees. It was a regular
door, with a knob, hinges and all, but the
funny part of it was there didn't seem to be a
room on either side of it.</p>

<p>"This is remarkable!" exclaimed Wiggily,
"remarkable" meaning the same thing as
queer. "It is very odd! Here is a door and
the jamb&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where's the jamb?" asked a little katydid,
who was sitting on a leaf in the sun. "I'm
very fond of jam."</p>

<p>"I didn't say j-a-m&mdash;the kind you eat on
bread," spoke Uncle Wiggily. "I was talking
about the j-a-m-b&mdash;with a b&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bees make honey," said the katydid, "and
honey's almost as good as jam. I'm not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
fussy as all that. Jam or honey&mdash;honey or
jam, it's all the same to me."</p>

<p>"No, there isn't any honey, either," said
the bunny. "The jamb of the door is the
wooden frame that goes around it, to hold it
in place."</p>

<p>"Then I don't want any door jamb&mdash;I want
bread and jam," said the katydid, hopping off
to find her sister, Katydidn't, leaving Uncle
Wiggily to stare at the lone door.</p>

<p>"Well," said the rabbit gentleman to himself,
"I may as well see what's on the other
side. Though a door standing all by itself in
the woods is the strangest thing I've ever
seen."</p>

<p>However, he turned the knob, opened the
door and stepped through, and, to his surprise,
he found himself in a big kitchen which
seemed magically to have appeared the
moment he entered the very surprising
place. At one end was a big stove, with a hot
fire in it, and on the stove was a boiling kettle
of soup, which was being stirred by a big fat
cook lady, who was shaped like a ham, without
the string in the end, of course. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
cook could stand up and didn't need to be
hung on a nail as a ham is hung before it's
cooked.</p>

<p>In front of the fire was another large lady
with a bonnet on almost as big as the Hatter's
hat. Over the bonnet was a fluffy, flowing
veil.</p>

<p>"Now please be quiet&mdash;do!" exclaimed the
sitting down lady to something in her lap,
and Uncle Wiggily saw that it was a baby.
"Come, cook!" she cried. "Is that hot soup
ready yet for the baby?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, mum. But it soon will be," answered
the cook, and Uncle Wiggily was just
going to say something about not giving a
little baby hot soup, when the door opened
again, and in came Alice from Wonderland.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad you're here, Uncle Wiggily!"
cried Alice. "Now it will be all right."</p>

<p>"What will?" asked the bunny. "What will
be right?"</p>

<p>"My left shoe," said Alice. "You see I just
came from the Pool of Tears, and everything
got all mixed up. When I came out I had two
left shoes instead of one being a right, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
now you are here it's all right&mdash;I mean one is
right and the other is left, as it should be,"
and with that Alice put on one shoe she had
been carrying in her hand, and smiled.</p>

<p>"But who is this?" asked Uncle Wiggily,
pointing with his red, white and blue striped
rheumatism crutch at the big lady holding
the baby, which was now squirming like an
angle worm.</p>

<p>"It's the Duchess&mdash;a friend of the Queen of
Hearts," answered Alice. "I'll introduce you
to her in a minute. Are you fond of sneezing?"</p>

<p>"Only when I have a cold," answered Uncle
Wiggily. "Why do you ask?" and he began
to think he was having a very funny adventure
indeed. "Why should I be fond of
sneezing?"</p>

<p>"Because you'll have to whether you like
it or not," answered Alice. "The Duchess is
going to talcum powder the baby now&mdash;it's
just had a bath."</p>

<p>With that the duchess, who is the wife of a
duke, you know, called:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, cook! Never mind the soup. Give
me the pepper!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<a href="images/071.png"><img src="images/th_071.png" width="280" height="400" alt="The Cook, Duchess, Baby, Uncle Wiggily and Alice" title="The Cook, Duchess, Baby, Uncle Wiggily and Alice" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Goodness me sakes alive and some horseradish
lollypops!" cried Uncle Wiggily. "She
isn't going to talcum powder the baby with
pepper, is she?"</p>

<p>"Of course," answered Alice. "It's that
way in the book from which I came to have an
adventure with you, so, of course, pepper it
has to be. Look out&mdash;here come the
sneezes!" and Alice got out her handkerchief.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily saw the duchess, with a
funny smile on her big face, take the pepper-box
the cook gave her and start to sprinkle
the black stuff over the baby in her lap. The
baby was cooing and gurgling&mdash;as all babies
do after their bath&mdash;and didn't seem at all to
mind her being peppered.</p>

<p>"They season chickens and turkeys with
salt and pepper, so why not babies?" asked
Alice of Uncle Wiggily. The bunny gentleman
was just going to say he did not know
the answer to that riddle, when the door suddenly
opened again and in came a great big
dodo bird, which is something like a skillery-scalery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
alligator, only worse, with a beak like
that of a mosquito.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" chirped the dodo. "At last I have
found him!" and he made a dart with his big
beak for Uncle Wiggily. The dodo was just
going to grab the bunny gentleman in his
claws, and Mr. Longears was so shivery he
didn't know what to do, when the duchess,
suddenly tossing the baby to the cook, cried:</p>

<p>"Ha! No you don't! I guess it's you I want
to pepper instead!" and with that she shook
the box of pepper at the dodo, who began
sneezing as hard as he could sneeze.</p>

<p>"Aker-choo! Aker-choo! Aker-choo!"
sneezed the dodo.</p>

<p>"Keer-zoo! Keer-zoo! Keer-zoo!" sneezed
the duchess.</p>

<p>"Goo-snitzio! Goo-snitzio! Goo-snitzio!"
sneezed Alice.</p>

<p>"Fizz-buzzy-wuzz! Fizz-buzzy-wuzz! Fizz-buzzy-wuzz!"
sneezed Uncle Wiggily, and
then the dodo himself gave another very
large special five and ten cent store sale
sneeze and blew himself backward out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
door. So he didn't get Uncle Wiggily after
all.</p>

<p>"And now we are all right," said Alice,
when they had all finished sneezing, including
the baby. "Have some soup, Uncle
Wiggily."</p>

<p>So the bunny did, finding it very good, and
made from cabbage and pretzels and then he
went home to his stump bungalow.</p>

<p>And if the lollypop stick doesn't have to go
out and help the wash lady hold up the
clothesline when it goes fishing for apple pie
I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the
cook.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE COOK</span></h2>


<p>"Well, Mr. Longears, I shall have to leave
you all alone today," said Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, as
she gave Uncle Wiggily, the bunny rabbit
gentleman, his breakfast in the hollow
stump bungalow one morning.</p>

<p>"Leave me all alone&mdash;how does that happen?"
asked Uncle Wiggily, sort of sad and
sorrowful like. "Do you mean you are going
to leave me for good?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I'm just going to be busy all day
sewing mosquito shirts for the animal boy
soldiers who are going off to war. Since you
taught them how to shoot their talcum powder
guns at the bad biting bugs, Sammie
Littletail, your rabbit nephew, and Johnnie
and Billie Bushytail, the squirrels; Jackie
and Peetie Bow Wow, the puppy dogs, and all
the other Woodland chaps have been bothered
with the mosquitoes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"They made war enough on me," said Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>"And, since they could not catch you, they
are starting war against your friends," went
on Nurse Jane, "so I am making mosquito
shirts for the animal boys. I'll be away sewing
all day, and you'll have to get your own
lunch, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid!" laughed brave Uncle
Wiggily. "If I could get away from the bad,
biting mosquitoes, I guess I can get my own
lunch. Besides, maybe Alice from Wonderland
will come along and help me."</p>

<p>"Maybe," spoke Nurse Jane. Then the
muskrat lady, tying her tail up in a pink-blue
hair ribbon, scurried off, while Uncle Wiggily
hopped over the fields and through the
woods, looking for an adventure.</p>

<p>But adventures, or things that happen to
you, seemed to be scarce that day, and it was
noontime before the bunny gentleman
hardly knew it.</p>

<p>"Well!" he exclaimed. "I'm getting hungry,
and, as I didn't bring any cherry pie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
with me I'll have to skip along to my hollow
stump bungalow for something to eat."</p>

<p>Nurse Jane had left some things on the
table for the bunny gentleman to eat for his
lunch. There were cold carrot sandwiches,
cold cabbage tarts, cold turnip unsidedowns&mdash;which
are like turnovers only different&mdash;and
cold lettuce pancakes.</p>

<p>"But it seems to me," said Uncle Wiggily,
"it seems to me that I would like something
hot. I think I'll make a soup of all these
things as I saw the cook doing when I went
through the funny little door and met Alice
from Wonderland in the kitchen of the
Duchess."</p>

<p>So, getting a large soup kettle, Uncle Wiggily
put into it the cold carrot sandwiches, the
cold lettuce pancakes, the cold cabbage tarts
and so on. Then he built a fire in the stove.</p>

<p>"For," said he, "if those things are good
cold they are better hot. I shall have a fine
hot lunch."</p>

<p>Then Uncle Wiggily sat down to wait for
the things to cook, and every once in a while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
he would look at the kettle on the stove and
say:</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall have a fine, hot lunch!"</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, after the bunny
rabbit gentleman had said this about five-and-ten-cent-store
times a voice cried:</p>

<p>"Indeed you will have a hot lunch!" and all
of a sudden into the kitchen of the hollow
stump bungalow came the red hot flamingo
bird, eager to burn the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. "I&mdash;I
don't seem to know you very well."</p>

<p>"You'll know me better after a bit," said
the red flamingo bird, clashing its beak like
a pair of tailor's shears. "I'm the bird that
Alice from Wonderland used for a croquet
mallet when she played with the Queen of
Hearts."</p>

<p>"Oh, now I know!" said the bunny. "Won't
you have lunch with me?" he asked, trying to
be polite. "I'm having a hot lunch, though
Nurse Jane left me a cold one, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are going to have a much hotter
lunch than you imagine!" said the red flamingo
bird. "Look out! I'm getting sizzling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
hot!" And indeed he was, which made him
such a red color, I suppose. "I'm going to
burn you!" cried the bird to Uncle Wiggily,
sticking out his red tongue.</p>

<p>"Burn me? Why?" asked the poor bunny
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Oh, because I have to burn somebody, and
it might as well be you!" said the flamingo.
"Look out, now!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Indeed! And it's you who had better
look out!" cried a new voice. And with that
the cook&mdash;the same big lady, shaped like a
ham, whom Uncle Wiggily had last seen in
the kitchen of the Duchess&mdash;this cook hopped
nimbly in through a window of the hollow
stump bungalow.</p>

<p>"I'll fix him!" she cried, catching up the
flatirons from the shelf over the stove and
throwing them at the flamingo. "Get out!
Scat! Sush! Run away!" And she threw
the fire shovel, the dustpan, the sink shovel,
the stove lifter, the broom and the coal
scuttle at the flamingo. My, but that cook
was a thrower!</p>

<p>She didn't hit the red flamingo bird with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
any of the things she threw, but she tossed
them so very hard, and seemingly with such
anger, that the bird was frightened.</p>

<p>"This is no place for me!" cried the flaming
red bird, drawing in his red tongue. "I'll go
make it hot for Mr. Whitewash, the polar
bear. He might like some heat for a change
from his cake of ice."</p>

<p>Then the red flamingo bird, not burning
Uncle Wiggily at all, flew away, and the cook,
after she had picked up all the kitchen things
she had thrown, came in and had a hot
lunch with Uncle Wiggily, who thanked her
very much.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you came," said the bunny, "but
I didn't know you cooks threw things."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm from the Wonderland Alice book,
which makes me different," the cook answered.
And she was queer. But everything
came out all right, you see, and if the trolley
car conductor doesn't punch the transfer so
hard that it falls off the seat, I'll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and the Baby.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BABY</span></h2>


<p>"Well," said Uncle Wiggily Longears, the
rabbit gentleman, to himself, as he stood in
the middle of the woods and looked around.
"I don't seem to be going to have any adventures
today at all. I wonder what's the
matter?"</p>

<p>Something was wrong, that is certain.</p>

<p>The bunny uncle had been hopping along
all the morning, and part of the afternoon,
and not a single adventure had he found. Almost
always something happened to him, but
this time was different.</p>

<p>He had not met Alice from Wonderland,
nor any of her queer relations, and Uncle
Wiggily had not seen any of his animal boy
or girl friends, so the rabbit gentleman was
beginning to feel a bit lonesome.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, before you could
count a million (providing you had time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
wanted to), Uncle Wiggily saw, fluttering
from a tree, what he thought was a flag.</p>

<p>"That's queer," he said to himself, only out
loud. "I wonder if any of my mosquito
enemies have made a camp there under the
trees, and are flying the flag before they come
to bite me? I'll go closer and see."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily was very brave, you know,
even if he only had his red, white and blue
striped rheumatism crutch instead of the
talcum powder popgun that shot bean-bag
bullets. So up he went to where he thought
he saw the mosquito enemy's flag fluttering,
and my goodness me sakes alive and some
chocolate cake ginger snaps! It wasn't the
mosquito flag at all, which shows that we
ought never to be afraid until we are sure
what a thing is&mdash;and sometimes not then.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a lady's veil!" cried Uncle Wiggily,
as he looked at the fluttering thing.
And, as he said that, someone, who was sitting
on an old log, turned around, and&mdash;there
was the Wonderland Duchess herself&mdash;the
queer, stout lady who looked like a barrel of
flour&mdash;very rich you know!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>"Oh, hello, Uncle Wiggily!" called the
Duchess, who is a sort of princess grown up.
"I'm glad to see you. I have a friend of yours
here with me!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean Alice?" asked the bunny.</p>

<p>"No, this time it's the Baby," answered the
Duchess, and then Uncle Wiggily saw that
she had a live baby in her arms upside down.
I mean the baby was upside down, not the
arms of the Duchess, though perhaps it
would have been better that way.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" cried Uncle Wiggily. "That's
no way to hold the child."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said the Duchess, sort of
sniffing proud like. "Then if you know so
much about holding babies, take this one. I
have to go make a rice pudding," and before
Uncle Wiggily could stop her she tossed the
baby to him as if it were a ball and ran away,
crying:</p>

<p>"Rice! Rice! Who has the rice pudding?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" Uncle Wiggily started to say,
but that was all he had time for, as he had to
catch Baby, which he managed to do right
side up. This was a good thing, I think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>"You poor little dear!" cried the bunny
uncle as he smoothed out the Baby's clothes
and looked around for a nursing bottle or a
rattle box. And, as he was doing this, and
while the Baby was trying to close its lips,
which it had opened to cry with when it found
itself skedaddling through the air&mdash;while
this was going on, some one gave a loud
laugh, and Uncle Wiggily, looking around in
surprise, saw Alice from Wonderland.</p>

<p>"Well!" said the bunny. "I'm glad to see
you, but what is there to laugh at?"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the baby!" said Alice, sort of choking
like, for she was trying to talk and laugh
at the same time.</p>

<p>"Why should you laugh at a poor baby,
whom no one seems to know how to care
for?" asked Uncle Wiggily. "Why, I ask
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! But look what it's turning into!" said
Alice, pointing.</p>

<p>The bunny uncle looked at what he held in
his paws. It was wiggling, twisting and
squirming in such a funny way, squee-geeing
its dress all up around its face that for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
moment Uncle Wiggily could not get a good
look, but, when he did, he cried:</p>

<p>"My goodness me sakes alive and some
bacon gravy! It's a little pig!"</p>

<p>And so it was! As he held it the baby had
turned into a tiny pig, with a funny nose and
half-shut eyes.</p>

<p>"Bless my rheumatism crutch!" cried
Uncle Wiggily. "What made it do that?"</p>

<p>"Because it's that way in the book where I
came from," said Alice. "You read and you'll
see that the baby which the Duchess gives me
to hold turns into a little pig."</p>

<p>"But she gave it to ME to hold!" cried
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"It's much the same thing," spoke Alice.
"As long as it's a pig it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"But dear me hum suz dud!" cried the
bunny. "I don't want to be carrying around
a little pig. Of course I like pigs, and I'm
very fond of my friends Curley and Floppy
Twisty-tail, the little grunters. But this baby
pig&mdash;"</p>

<p>And, just as Uncle Wiggily said that, who
should come along but a bad old skillery-scalery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
hump-tailed alligator, walking on his
hind legs, with his two front claws stretched
out in front of him.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" cried the bad alligator, who had
promised to be good, but who had not kept
his word. "Ah, ha! At last I have caught
you, Uncle Wiggily, and Wonderland Alice,
too!"</p>

<p>He was just going to grab them when the
little Baby Pig, who had been squirming very
hard all the while, finally squirmed out of
Uncle Wiggily's paws, fell to the ground, and
then, running right between the legs of the
alligator, as pigs always do run, the squealing
chap upset the bad, unpleasant creature,
knocking him over in a frontward somersault
and also backward peppersault down the
steps.</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness!" cried the skillery-scalery
alligator. "I'm killed!" Which he
wasn't at all, but he thought so, and this
frightened him so much that he ran away and
didn't catch Uncle Wiggily or Alice after all,
for which I'm glad.</p>

<p>And if the puppy dog doesn't take all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
bark off the sassafras tree and leave none for
the pussy cat to polish her claws on, I'll tell
you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Mock-Turtle.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MOCK-TURTLE</span></h2>


<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Will you please take
me with you this morning?" asked a little
voice, somewhere down near the lower, or
floor-end, of the old rabbit gentleman's rheumatism
crutch, as Mr. Longears sat at the breakfast
table in his hollow stump bungalow.
"Please take me with you!"</p>

<p>"Well, who are you, and where do you want
to be taken?" asked the bunny.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm Squeaky-Eeky, the little cousin
mouse," was the answer, "and I want you to
take me with you on one of your walks, so I
can have an adventure as you do with Alice in
Wonderland."</p>

<p>"But perhaps I may not see Alice in Wonderland,"
spoke Uncle Wiggily. "I do not always
have that pleasure."</p>

<p>"Well, then, perhaps we'll see the Baby or
the Duchess, or the Gryphon or some of the
funny folk who make such jolly fun with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
you," went on Squeaky-Eeky. "I have a holiday
from school today, because they are
painting the blackboards white, and I'd like
to come with you."</p>

<p>"Come along then!" cried Uncle Wiggily,
giving the little cousin mouse a bit of cheese
cake with some lettuce sugar sprinkled over
the top. "We'll see what sort of adventure
happens today."</p>

<p>So, calling good-bye to Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, Uncle
Wiggily and Squeaky-Eeky started off over
the fields and through the woods. They had
not gone very far before, all at once, as they
walked along a little path under the trees
they saw a funny thing lying near a clump of
ferns.</p>

<p>It looked like a mud turtle at first, but after
peering at it through his glasses Uncle Wiggily
saw that the larger part was made of a
half-round stone. In front of that was part
of a broken rubber ball, and sticking out at
the four corner places were four pieces of
wood, like little claws, while at the back was
a piece of an old leather boot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"My! I wonder what in the world this can
be?" said Uncle Wiggily, surprised like.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's something from Alice in Wonderland,"
spoke Squeaky-Eeky, the cousin
mouse.</p>

<p>"You are right&mdash;I am!" exclaimed a voice.
"I am the Mock-Turtle and I have just gotten
out of the soup."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad to meet you!" cried
Squeaky. "I've always wanted to see what a
real mock turtle looked like, ever since I read
the book about Alice."</p>

<p>"Hum!" grunted the queer creature.
"There's no such thing as a real mock turtle
any more than there is a make-believe toothache."</p>

<p>"I hope you never have that," said Squeaky-Eeky,
politely.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I don't care for any," answered
the Mock-Turtle, just as if the little
cousin mouse had passed the cakes. And
then the turtle began to sing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
"Speak gently to your toothache drops,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And do not let them fall.</span><br />
&nbsp;And when you have the measle-mumps,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They'll scarcely hurt at all."</span>
</p>

<p>"Mine did," said Squeaky-Eeky, wondering
if this was what Alice would have answered.
But the Mock-Turtle kept right on
with:</p>

<p class="poem">
"Once a tramp was seated on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A chair made out of cheese.</span><br />
&nbsp;He ate the legs and then he fell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down with a terrible sneeze."</span>
</p>

<p>"That isn't right," said Squeaky-Eeky.
"It's a trap that was baited with a piece of
cheese, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" suddenly exclaimed the Mock-Turtle.
"Here he comes!"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked the little cousin mouse. "Do
you mean the tramp?"</p>

<p>Before the Mock-Turtle could answer
along came shuffling a big, shaggy bear. At
first Uncle Wiggily and the little cousin
mouse thought perhaps it was Neddie or
Beckie Stubtail, one of the good bear children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
but instead it was a bad old tramp sort
of a bear&mdash;the kind that goes about taking
honey out of beehives.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" growled the bear. "A rabbit and
a mouse! That's fine for me! I shall have a
good dinner, I'm sure!" and he smacked his
red tongue against his teeth.</p>

<p>"Where will you get your dinner?" asked
Uncle Wiggily, curious like.</p>

<p>"There is no restaurant or kitchen around
here," went on Squeaky-Eeky.</p>

<p>"Never you mind about that!" cried the
bear. "I'll attend to you at dessert. Just
now I want Uncle Wiggily to come here and
count how many teeth I have," and he opened
his mouth real wide, the bear did.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I don't want to count your teeth,"
said the poor bunny gentleman, for well he
knew what the bear's trick would be. The
bear wanted to bite Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"You must count my teeth!" growled the
shaggy creature, coming close to Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>"No, let me do it!" suddenly cried the
Mock-Turtle. "I am good at counting."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't make any difference who
does it," said the bear. Then, going close
over to where the Mock-Turtle sat on the
path, the bear opened wide his mouth. And
then, just as he would have done to the rabbit
gentleman, the bear made a savage bite
for the Mock-Turtle.</p>

<p>But you know what happened. Instead of
biting on something good, like a lollypop, the
bear bit on the hard stone, of which the top
part of Mock, or Make-Believe, Turtle was
made, and the stone was so gritty and tough
that the bear's teeth all broke off, and then
he couldn't bite even a jelly fish.</p>

<p>"Oh, wow! Oh, woe is me!" cried the bear,
as he ran to see if he could find a dentist to
make him some false teeth.</p>

<p>"And he didn't hurt me a bit," laughed the
Mock-Turtle, made of stone, wood and
leather, who was built that way on purpose
to fool bad bears and such like. "I don't mind
in the least being bitten," said the pretend
turtle.</p>

<p>"But you saved my life, and Squeaky-Eeky's,
too," said Uncle Wiggily. "I thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
you!" Then the Mock-Turtle crawled away
and the bunny and mousie girl had a fine
time together. And if the milk wagon
doesn't go swimming down on the board
walk with the watering cart and make the ice
cream jump over the lollypop, I'll tell you
next about Uncle Wiggily and the Lobster.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LOBSTER</span></h2>


<p>"You'll be home to supper, won't you?"
asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady housekeeper, as she saw her friend,
Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
hopping down off the front porch of the
hollow stump bungalow one morning.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'll be home," he answered, "I'm
just going to look for a little adventure."</p>

<p>Then, not having been on the board walk
in quite a while, Uncle Wiggily went down to
the ocean seashore beach.</p>

<p>"For," said the old rabbit gentleman to
himself, "I have not had a seashore adventure
in some time. And, perhaps, my friend,
Alice, from Wonderland, may be down there.
I know in her story book there are many
curious things that happen near the sea."</p>

<p>So down to the shore went Uncle Wiggily
and as he was walking along, looking at the
funny marks his feet made in the wet sand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
all of a sudden he came to a pile of damp,
green seaweed, and from underneath it he
heard a voice calling:</p>

<p>"Oh, help me out! Please help me out!"</p>

<p>"Ha! That sounds like some one in
trouble!" Uncle Wiggily said. "I must help
them." Then with his red, white and blue
striped rheumatism crutch that Nurse Jane
had gnawed for him out of a lollypop stick,
the bunny poked away the seaweed, and
underneath it, all tangled up so he could
hardly move, was a Lobster gentleman.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was so good of you to get me out,"
said the Lobster as he gave a flip-flap with his
tail. "An old crab, who doesn't like me, piled
the seaweed over my back as I was taking a
nap in the sun. My long thin legs were all
tangled in it, and even with my big pinching
claws I could not get loose, and I was so afraid
I'd be late."</p>

<p>"Late for what?" asked Uncle Wiggily,
wondering where the Lobster was going.</p>

<p>"To the dance&mdash;the quadrille, of course,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, now I remember," said the bunny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
"It's in the Wonderland Alice book. You
have to go to a dance, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the Lobster. "I'd be pleased
to have you come with me."</p>

<p>"I will," promised Uncle Wiggily, thinking
maybe he would have an adventure there. So
down the beach started the Lobster gentleman
and the bunny uncle. On and on they
went for a long, long time, it seemed to Uncle
Wiggily, and it was getting quite late, as he
could tell by the star fish which were twinkling
on the beach, and still they had seen no
signs of a dance.</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," said the Lobster.
"Alice said I was to walk until I met her, and
she'd take me to the party. And we certainly
have been walking a long time."</p>

<p>"We have," agreed Uncle Wiggily. "It is
so late I'm afraid I'll have to leave you and go
home to supper, as I promised Nurse Jane."</p>

<p>"That's too bad," went on the Lobster. "I
wanted you to see how well I can dance on the
end of my tail. But I can't understand why
we don't get to the quadrille. We certainly
have walked down the beach, haven't we?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have," answered the bunny. "But&mdash;Ah!
I have it!" Uncle Wiggily suddenly
cried. "You have been walking BACKWARD,
and I have been following you. We
have been going <b>away</b> from the dance instead
of <b>toward</b> it."</p>

<p>"Of course!" cried the Lobster, in a cold
and clammy voice. "Why didn't I think of
that before? I always have to go backward,
on account of my claws being so heavy I have
to pull them after me, instead of pushing
them ahead.</p>

<p>"And so, of course, going backward as I
do, and as all Lobsters do, when I want to get
anywhere I always turn my back toward it,
and get to it that way. This time I forgot to
do that."</p>

<p>"But what can we do now?" Uncle Wiggily
wanted to know. "How can we get to the
dance?"</p>

<p>"I'll just turn around and back up to it,"
spoke the Lobster. "I'm sorry to have mixed
things up for you, especially as you were so
kind as to get me from under the pile of seaweed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry!" laughed Uncle Wiggily,
jolly-like. "I dare say it will be all right.
Come on!"</p>

<p>So the lobster turned around and began to
back toward where he hoped to find the
dance. It grew darker and darker, and the
star fish were twinkling more than ever, and
then, all of a sudden, they came to the hollow
stump bungalow where Uncle Wiggily lived.</p>

<p>"Hurray!" cried the Lobster. "Here we are
at the quadrille. Now I'll explain to Alice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, this isn't the dance," said Uncle Wiggily.
"This is where I live. But I'd be pleased
to have you come in to supper, and we can go
to the dance tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I will!" cried the Lobster, after thinking
about it.</p>

<p>Into the hollow stump bungalow they went,
the Lobster backing in, of course, and Uncle
Wiggily cried:</p>

<p>"Supper for two, if you please, Nurse
Jane!"</p>

<p>"Right away!" answered the muskrat lady.
And she began to set the table. And then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
while Uncle Wiggily and the Lobster were
talking together Nurse Jane called:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I've lost the can opener, and I
can't open this tin of peaches. What shall I
do?"</p>

<p>"Let me try!" begged Uncle Wiggily. But
his paws were not big enough.</p>

<p>"I'll do it!" said the Lobster. And with his
strong, pinching claws he punched open the
can of peaches as easily as you can eat a
chocolate cream drop. It was no trouble at
all for him. So it was a good thing Uncle
Wiggily brought the Lobster home for supper,
you see.</p>

<p>And if the stairs don't stand on their heads
and with their toes tickle all the holes out of
the lawn tennis nets, I'll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and Father William.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND FATHER WILLIAM</span></h2>


<p>One morning, soon after he had finished
his breakfast, having taken his red, white
and blue striped barber pole rheumatism
crutch down from behind the clock, Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
started out from his hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>There were quite a few friends of the little
girl named Alice in Wonderland whom he had
not yet met, and he hoped to have an adventure
with one of them. So, tossing up in the
air his tall silk stovepipe hat, and letting it
bounce three times on the end of his pink
nose, Uncle Wiggily hurried off.</p>

<p>The rabbit gentleman had not gone very
far, over the fields and through the woods,
before he saw something very strange indeed.
This something was what seemed to
be a funny sort of flower vase, with two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
things sticking up in it, and on the end of
them were two shoes.</p>

<p>"My goodness me, sakes alive and some
chocolate cake pudding!" cried the surprised
bunny uncle. "What's this?"</p>

<p>Then, as he looked again, he saw a funny
face, and a pair of bright eyes looking at him
from the bottom part of what seemed to be
a flower vase.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a man!" cried Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm a man," was the jolly answer.
"But don't be afraid of me; I'm not a
hunter man."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;you're standing on your head!"
went on Uncle Wiggily, more surprised than
ever.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm standing on my head!" said
the funny man. "I have to do that to make
things come out as they do in the Alice in
Wonderland book. I'm Father William, you
know," and with that he gave a nimble
spring, turned a back somersault, putting
himself right side up, and began to recite
this verse:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
"You are old, Father William, the Young Man said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And your hair has become very white.</span><br />
&nbsp;But yet you incessantly stand on your head.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do you think, at your age, that is right?"</span>
</p>

<p>"But is it?" asked Uncle Wiggily quickly,
as soon as funny Father William had ceased
speaking.</p>

<p>"Of course it is," was the answer. "Otherwise
it wouldn't be in the book and I wouldn't
do it. At first it came very hard to me, but
now I can easily manage. And you'll find you
get quite a different view of things, looking
at them upside down as I do every now and
then," he went on.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I could stand on my head?"
spoke Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Try it," said Father William.</p>

<p>"I'd like to," went on the bunny uncle. "But
I might crush my tall silk hat."</p>

<p>"Take it off," suggested Father William.</p>

<p>"Yes, I could do that. But suppose some
one were to see me?" asked the bunny. "It
would look sort of queer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"No one will see you here behind the trees,"
spoke Father William. "Besides, if they do,
learning to stand on one's head is very useful.
There is no telling when you may want
to do it at home."</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed Uncle Wiggily. "Well,
I'll try."</p>

<p>At first he couldn't stand up on his head at
all, just turning over in a sort of flip-flop
every time he tried. But at last Father William
held up the bunny rabbit by the heels,
and then Uncle Wiggily did it better. After
a while he could stand straight, right side up,
on his hind paws, give a little wiggle, and
then suddenly, with a funny twist and a
somersault flop, there he was, standing on his
head, with his silk hat twirling around on his
upper paws. And Father William could do
the same thing.</p>

<p>If you had happened to walk through the
woods when Uncle Wiggily and Father
William, who had a little holiday from the
Alice book, were standing on their heads,
surely you would have laughed.</p>

<p>"And, now that I have learned a new trick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
I must go look for an adventure," said the
bunny.</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," spoke Father William.
Together they went along through the woods
and over the fields and, all of a sudden, from
behind a currant jam bush, out jumped a bad,
old, double-jointed skillery-scalery alligator.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" cried the alligator. "At last I
have caught some one to whom I can do it!
Ah, ha!"</p>

<p>"Do what?" asked Uncle Wiggily, while
Father William looked around for a place to
hide. "What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Tickle your feet!" was the surprising answer.
"I am the ticklish alligator, and feet I
must tickle! Get ready now, here I come."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" cried Father William. "I
never can bear to have my feet tickled. For,
when that happens I laugh and then I sneeze
and then I catch cold and have to go to bed.
Oh, dear! I don't want my feet tickled!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Uncle Wiggily, as the
'gator was hopping toward them. "You won't
have to suffer that! Quick! Stand on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
head as you taught me to, and hold your feet
up in the air!"</p>

<p>And in the twinkle of a spiced pear Uncle
Wiggily and Father William were standing
on their heads. The surprised alligator saw
them, and after trying to reach their feet
with his claws, which he couldn't do, as they
were up in the air, he cried:</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! Thought you'd fool me, didn't
you, by standing on your heads! Well, I'll
tickle your feet after all. I'll climb a tree and
reach down to them!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! He'll make me catch cold no
matter what I do," sighed Father William.</p>

<p>"No, he won't," said Uncle Wiggily. "The
alligator is very good at climbing up trees,
but it takes him ever so long to climb down.
As soon as he climbs up we'll stop standing
on our heads. We'll flip-flop to our feet and
run away."</p>

<p>And that's exactly what the bunny and
Father William did. As soon as the alligator
was up in the tree branches they turned a
flip-flop, stood up straight and away they ran,
and the alligator was all day getting down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
out of the tree. So he didn't tickle their feet
after all, but he might have if Uncle Wiggily
had not learned to stand on his head.</p>

<p>And if the ice wagon doesn't slide down hill
and throw snowballs at the potato pudding in
the parlor I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and the magic bottles.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MAGIC BOTTLES</span></h2>


<p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
was hopping along through the
woods one morning after having eaten
breakfast in his hollow stump bungalow,
when, just as he reached a nice, grassy place,
near a spring of water, he saw the little
flaxen-haired girl, Alice from Wonderland,
coming toward him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad to see you!" cried Alice.
"You are just in time to win the first prize."</p>

<p>She handed the gentleman rabbit a little
bottle, filled with what seemed to be water,
and stoppered with a blue cork.</p>

<p>"First prize for what?" asked Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>"For getting here early," answered Alice.
"And you also get second prize, too," and she
handed him another bottle, stoppered with a
red cork.</p>

<p>"Why do I get second prize?" asked the
bunny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"For not being late," answered Alice with
a smile. "It is very simple. First prize for
being early, second prize for not being late."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Uncle Wiggily, sort of
scratching his pink, twinkling nose, thoughtful
like. "It's much the same thing, it seems
to me."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Alice, quickly. "The
prizes are very different. Those bottles are
magical. They are filled with water from the
pool of tears. If you drink a few drops from
the one with the blue cork you will grow very
small. And if you take some of the water
from the red-stoppered bottle you will grow
very large. Be careful of your prizes."</p>

<p>"I will," promised Uncle Wiggily. "Are
there any others coming?" he asked, looking
about through the trees.</p>

<p>"Any others coming where?" inquired
Alice.</p>

<p>"Here. I mean, might they have gotten
prizes, too?"</p>

<p>"No, only you," said the flaxen-haired girl.
"You were the only one expected."</p>

<p>"But," spoke the puzzled bunny rabbit, "if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
I was the only one expected, what was the use
of giving prizes? No one else could have gotten
here ahead of me; could they?"</p>

<p>"Please don't ask me," begged Alice. "All
I know is that it's one of the riddles like those
the March Hare asks, such as 'What makes
the mirror look crooked at you?' The answer
is it doesn't if you don't. In this case you
get the prizes because there is no one else to
give them to. So take them and have an adventure.
I have to go see what the Duchess
wants."</p>

<p>With that Alice faded away like the
Cheshire Cat, beginning at her head and ending
up at her feet, the last things to go being
the buttons on her shoes.</p>

<p>"Well," said Uncle Wiggily to himself, "I
have two prizes, it seems, of magic bottles. I
wonder what I am to do with them?"</p>

<p>He looked at the red and blue corked bottles,
holding one in each paw, and he was
wondering whether it would be best to grow
small or large, when, all at once, he felt himself
caught from behind by a pair of big
claws, and, looking over his shoulder, as best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
he could, Uncle Wiggily saw that he was held
fast by a big alligator; a skillery-scalery chap
with a double-jointed tail that he could swing
back and forth like a pantry door.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! I have you!" gurgled the 'gator.</p>

<p>"Yes, I see you have!" said Uncle Wiggily,
sadly.</p>

<p>"You thought you and Father William
would fool me by standing on your heads so I
couldn't tickle your feet," went on the 'gator,
as I call him for short. "But I got down out
of the tree, and here I am. I have you now
and you can't get away from me!"</p>

<p>Indeed it did seem so, for he held Uncle
Wiggily very tight and fast in his claws.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" asked
the rabbit.</p>

<p>"Take you home to my den, and my dear
little foxes, Eight, Nine and Ten," said the
alligator.</p>

<p>"Foxes!" cried Uncle Wiggily. "Have you
foxes?"</p>

<p>"I have!" answered the alligator. "I am
keeping them until their father gets back
from a hunting trip, and they are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
hungry. Their father is the fox who went out
'in a hungry plight, and he begged of the
moon to give him light, for he'd many miles
to go that night, before he could reach his
den-O.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, now I remember," said Uncle Wiggily.
"It's in Mother Goose."</p>

<p>"Yes, and so is the rest of it," went on the
alligator. "'At last the fox reached home to
his den, and his dear little foxes, Eight, Nine,
Ten.' Those are their names, though they
sound like numbers," said the 'gator. "I'll
soon introduce you to them. Come along!"</p>

<p>Now Uncle Wiggily did not like this at all.
He wanted to get away from the alligator,
but he did not know how he could do it. At
last he thought of the magical bottles Alice
had given him.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" thought Uncle Wiggily. "I'll
give the alligator a drink from the blue-corked
one, and we'll see what happens." So
Uncle Wiggily slyly said to the 'gator:</p>

<p>"Before you take me off to your den, would
you not like a drink from this bottle to refresh
you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I would," said the skillery-scalery
creature, not at all politely. "I was going to
take some anyhow whether you asked me or
not."</p>

<p>With that he took the blue-corked bottle
from the paw of the bunny rabbit gentleman,
pulled out the stopper with his teeth and
drank a few drops.</p>

<p>And, no sooner had he done that, than the
alligator began to shrink. First he became
as small as a dog, then as little as a cat, then
as tiny as a kitten, then no larger than a bird
and finally he was no bigger than a baby
angle worm. And when the alligator became
that size Uncle Wiggily was not afraid and
easily got away from him, taking the two
magic bottles.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" cried the 'gator in a baby angle
worm voice, which was about as loud as the
head of a pin. "How foolish I was to drink
from the magic bottle and grow small."</p>

<p>But it served him right, I think, and the
bunny uncle was safe. And if the head of the
table doesn't step on the front door mat and
make it slide off the porch I'll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and the croquet ball.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CROQUET BALL</span></h2>


<p>"Why in the world are you taking those
bottles with you?" asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, as she
saw Uncle Wiggily, the bunny rabbit gentleman,
hopping off the front porch of his hollow
stump bungalow one morning.</p>

<p>"These are the prizes which Alice from
Wonderland gave me," answered Mr. Longears,
as he looked at the blue and red corked
bottles. "The red one makes things grow
larger and the blue one makes them smaller.
I am going to take them with me as I go looking
for an adventure today, as there is no
telling when I might need them. I did yesterday,
when the alligator caught me. I
gave him a drink from the blue bottle and he
shrunk until he was no larger than a baby
angle worm."</p>

<p>The rabbit gentleman had not gone very
far, twinkling his pink nose as he hopped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
before, all of a sudden, he came to a place
where a big stone grew out of the ground,
and near it he heard a voice, saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>"Ha! That sounds like trouble!" exclaimed
the bunny. "Who are you and what is the
matter?" he asked, kindly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am a Lady Bug," was the answer,
"and I am so small that I either get lost all
the while, or all the other animals and bugs
in the forest step on me. Oh, I wish I were
larger so I could be more easily seen!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, you are rather hard to see," said
Uncle Wiggily, and he had to look twice
through his glasses before he could notice the
Lady Bug. At the first look he only half saw
her, but the second time he saw her fully.</p>

<p>"I'd like to be about as large as a June
Beetle," said the Lady Bug. "But I don't
s'pose I ever shall be."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes you will!" cried jolly Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"I will! How?" asked the Lady Bug,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I have here some water in a magic bottle,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
said the bunny. "I'll give you a few
drops of it, and it will make you grow larger."
So he took some water from the red-corked
flask, and let the Lady Bug sip it. Instantly
she grew as large as a turkey.</p>

<p>"Oh, now I'm too big," she said.</p>

<p>"I see you are," said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"I'll have to give you some from the other
bottle and make you grow smaller." So he
did, but he must have given a little too much,
for the Lady Bug suddenly grew as small as
the point of a baby pin.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is worse and worse," she said
sadly.</p>

<p>"I know it!" agreed Uncle Wiggily. "Wait,
I'll give you a little of both kinds," and he
did, so the Lady Bug grew to the size of a
small potato, which was just right, so she
would not get lost or stepped on.</p>

<p>After the Lady Bug had thanked him,
Uncle Wiggily, with his two magical bottles,
hopped on through the woods. He had not
gone very far before he saw Alice of Wonderland
and the Queen of Hearts playing croquet
on a grassy place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on, Uncle Wiggily!" called Alice.
"You're just in time for the game."</p>

<p>"Fine!" said the bunny uncle, taking a mallet
and round wooden ball which the Queen
handed him.</p>

<p>"Three strikes and you go out!" warned
the Queen.</p>

<p>"What does she mean?" asked Uncle Wiggily
of Alice. "This isn't baseball."</p>

<p>"She means," explained the little flaxen-haired
girl, "that if you miss striking the croquet
ball three times with your mallet you
have to go out and bring in some ice cream."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shan't mind that," the bunny rabbit
said. "In fact, I shall rather like it. Now,
what do I do&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Play ball!" suddenly cried the Queen of
Hearts, and she struck with her mallet the
croquet ball near her such a hard blow that it
sailed through the air and hit Uncle Wiggily
in the coat tails. And then something
cracked.</p>

<p>All at once the croquet ball began growing
larger! Bigger and bigger it grew, like a
snowball which you roll in the yard, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
it began to roll after Uncle Wiggily. Down
the croquet ground the big wooden ball
chased after him, rolling closer and closer.</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" cried the Queen of Hearts,
"What have I done?"</p>

<p>"The ball cracked the magical red stoppered
bottle that was in my coat tail pocket!"
cried Uncle Wiggily over his shoulder, as he
ran. "Some of the magic, big-growing water
spilled on the ball, and now it has turned into
a giant! Oh, it will crush me!"</p>

<p>And, really, it did seem as though the big
croquet ball would, for now it was as large as
a house and still growing, so strong was the
water in the magical bottle that had been
broken.</p>

<p>Larger and larger grew the croquet ball,
and faster and faster it rolled after Uncle
Wiggily. It was almost on his heels now, and
the bunny gentleman was running so fast
that his tall silk hat flew off.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do?" he cried.</p>

<p>Alice thought for a minute, then she called:</p>

<p>"Quick, Uncle Wiggily. Take out the blue-corked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
bottle and sprinkle some of that water
on the croquet ball! Hurry now!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily did. As he ran he turned
and threw back over his shoulder some of
the blue bottle water on the big rolling croquet
ball. And, all at once, just as the alligator
had done, the croquet ball shrank and
shrank until it was no larger than a boy's
marble, and then it couldn't hurt Uncle Wiggily
even if it did roll on him.</p>

<p>But it is a good thing he had that bottle of
shrinking water with him; isn't it?</p>

<p>And, if the expressman doesn't take the
baby carriage to ride the trunk down to the
five-and-ten-cent store to buy a new piano,
I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the
Do-do.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE DO-DO</span></h2>


<p>"I declare!" exclaimed Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper for
Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
"I declare, I'll never get it done&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Uncle Wiggily. "What
won't you get done?"</p>

<p>"All this housework," answered Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy. "You see, going over to call on Mrs.
Bushytail, the squirrel lady, last night I
didn't wash the supper dishes, and now I have
them to do, and also the breakfast dishes and
the sweeping and dusting and I ought to bake
a cake, and mend some of your socks and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whoa!" called Uncle Wiggily with a jolly
laugh, as though he had spoken to Munchie
Trot, the pony. "That's enough! Don't say
any more. You have too much work to do."</p>

<p>"And I'm worried about it," said Nurse
Jane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be," advised the rabbit gentleman.
"I'll stay and help you do it."</p>

<p>"No," said Nurse Jane. "Thank you just
the same, but I'd rather you wouldn't stay
around the hollow stump bungalow when
there is so much to do. You might get in my
way and I'd step on you. That would give me
the fidgets. It is very kind of you, but if you'll
go off and have an adventure I think that will
be best."</p>

<p>"Just as you say," agreed Uncle Wiggily.
"But I'd like to help. Can't I bring you a
diamond dishpan or a gold wash rag from the
five and ten cent store?"</p>

<p>"No! Hop along with you!" laughed Nurse
Jane. "I dare say I'll manage somehow."</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily hopped along, over the
fields and through the woods, and then he
suddenly said to himself:</p>

<p>"I know what I'll do. I'll play a little trick
on Nurse Jane. She shouldn't spend so much
time in the kitchen. A little is all right, but
there is too much trouble about housework.
Here I go off and have an adventure and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
has to slop around in dishwater. It isn't
right!"</p>

<p>Then the rabbit gentleman hopped along
until he came to a woodland telephone, made
from a trumpet vine flower, and into that he
called, speaking right into his own hollow
stump bungalow and to Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy!" called Uncle
Wiggily. "Can you come over to Mrs. Wibblewobble's
duck house right away?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I can," answered the muskrat
lady, "though I have a lot of work to do.
What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when you get there," said the
voice of Uncle Wiggily, pretending he was
Mrs. Wibblewobble, the duck lady. Then he
called up Mrs. Wibblewobble herself, told her
how he had fooled Nurse Jane, and asked the
duck lady, when the muskrat lady housekeeper
came, to keep her talking and visiting
as long as she could.</p>

<p>"And while Nurse Jane is at your house,
Mrs. Wibblewobble," said Uncle Wiggily,
over the trumpet vine telephone, "I'll run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
around the back way to the hollow stump
bungalow and do all the work."</p>

<p>"That will be a nice surprise for Nurse
Jane," the duck lady said.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily guessed so, too, and when
he thought Nurse Jane was safely at Mrs.
Wibblewobble's house, he went to the bungalow.
He took off his tall silk hat, laid aside his
red, white and blue striped rheumatism
crutch, and began with the dishes. There was
a large pile of them, but Uncle Wiggily was
brave.</p>

<p>"When I was a soldier I fought a great
many more mosquitoes than there are dishes
here," he said. "I will make believe the
plates, cups and saucers are the enemy, and
I will charge on them and souse them."</p>

<p>And Uncle Wiggily did, with a cake of soap
for a gun and washing powder to fire with.
But, still and with all, there were many
dishes, and when he thought of the beds to
make, the sweeping and dusting to be done
and the socks to mend, Uncle Wiggily said:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked a voice behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
him, and turning, he saw Alice from Wonderland.
With her was a queer bird, which had
a tail like that of a mouse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">
<a href="images/002.png"><img src="images/th_002.png" width="275" height="400" alt="Uncle Wiggily, Alice and the Do-do bird" title="Uncle Wiggily, Alice and the Do-do bird" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad to see you!" said Uncle Wiggily.
"But I can't go and have an adventure
with you, Alice, as I have to do all these
dishes. Then I have to do the sweeping and
do the dusting and do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough!" laughed Alice. "There
are too many Do-dos. I am just in time, I see.
My friend will help you," and she pointed to
the queer bird.</p>

<p>"What?" cried Uncle Wiggily. "Can he do
dishes?"</p>

<p>"He can do anything!" laughed Alice. "He
is the Do-do bird, and all I have to do is to
pinch his tail and he will work very fast."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it hurt him?" asked Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>"What, to work fast?" Alice wanted to
know.</p>

<p>"No, to pinch his tail."</p>

<p>"Not in the least," answered Alice. "He's
used to it. The only trouble is I have to keep
on pinching it to make him do things, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
that means I have to keep my finger and
thumb on his tail all the while and follow him
around. Now we'll begin to do things, dear
Do-do," and she pinched the bird's tail.</p>

<p>At once the bird began to wash dishes, and
soon they were all done, and then when the
Do-do started to do the beds Uncle Wiggily
thought of a new plan.</p>

<p>"As long as you have to pinch his tail," said
the bunny to Alice, "I'll get Nurse Jane's hair
curlers. You can snap them on his tail and
they'll keep pinching on it, and pinching on
it all the while, and you and I can go take a
walk."</p>

<p>"Fine!" cried Alice. So with the hair curlers
pinching his tail the Do-do bird quickly
did all the bungalow housework, and Uncle
Wiggily and Alice had a fine walk. And when
Nurse Jane came home from Mrs. Wibblewobble's
and found the work all done she was
very happy. And so was the Do-do, for he
loved to do dishes.</p>

<p>And if the teacup doesn't try to hide in the

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LORY</span></h2>


<p>Once upon a time the skillery-scalery alligator
was out walking in the fields near the
muddy river where he lived, and he happened
to meet a big spider.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Alligator," said Mr.
Spider. "Have you caught that Uncle Wiggily
Longears bunny yet?"</p>

<p>"I have not, I am sorry to say," answered
the alligator chap. "I've tried every way I
know how, but something always happens so
that he gets away. Either he is helped by
that funny book-girl, Alice from Wonderland,
or by some of her friends. I'm afraid
I'll never catch Uncle Wiggily."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you will," said Mr. Spider. "I'll
help you."</p>

<p>"How?" asked the 'gator, which was his
short name, though he was rather long.</p>

<p>"I'll crawl through the woods and over the
fields until I find him asleep," said Mr. Spider.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
"And, when I do, I'll spin a strong web around
and over him so he cannot get loose. Then
I'll come and tell you and you can get him."</p>

<p>"Very good," spoke Mr. Alligator. "Please
do it."</p>

<p>So the alligator went back to sleep in the
mud to wait until Mr. Spider should bring
him word that Uncle Wiggily was held fast in
the web.</p>

<p>And now let us see what happens to the
bunny gentleman. As he always did, he
started out from his hollow stump bungalow
one morning to look for an adventure. There
had been a little accident at breakfast time.
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady
housekeeper, had boiled the eggs too long
and they were as hard as bullets.</p>

<p>"You can't eat them," she said to Uncle
Wiggily. "I'll boil you some fresh ones."</p>

<p>"All right," laughed the bunny. "I don't
want to get indyspepsia by eating hard bullet
eggs. But I'll take them with me and give
them to Johnnie or Billie Bushytail, the squirrel
boys. They can crack hard nuts so they
must be able to crack hard boiled eggs."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>So it was that Uncle Wiggily, after having
eaten the newly boiled soft eggs, started
from his hollow stump bungalow with the
hard boiled eggs in his pocket.</p>

<p>He had not traveled very far before he
heard from behind a big log a voice crying:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! It isn't hard enough! It isn't
half hard enough!"</p>

<p>"What isn't?" asked Uncle Wiggily, as he
saw a funny looking bird with a very large
bill like a parrot's. "What isn't hard
enough?"</p>

<p>"This log of wood," was the answer. "I
need something hard to bite on to sharpen
my beak, but this wood is too soft."</p>

<p>"You are a funny bird," laughed the bunny
gentleman. "Who might you be?"</p>

<p>"I am the Lory bird," was the answer. "I
belong in the book with Alice of Wonderland,
but I'm out for a day's pleasure, and, as
I can't tell what I might have to eat, I thought
I'd sharpen my bill. But I can't find anything
hard enough to use as a grindstone."</p>

<p>"Suppose you try these," said Uncle Wiggily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
taking the hard boiled eggs out of his
pocket.</p>

<p>"The very thing!" cried the Lory. "These
will be fine for my bill!" With that he
champed his beak down on the hard eggs and
he had all he could do to bite them. "Now
I'll get my beak good and sharp," said Lory.
"You have done me a great favor, Uncle
Wiggily, and I hope some day to do you one."</p>

<p>"Pray, do not mention it," said the bunny
rabbit, modest-like and shy. Then, having
found a good use for the hard boiled eggs,
even if he didn't give them to the Bushytail
squirrel boys, Uncle Wiggily hopped along,
and the Lory kept on biting the shells for
practice.</p>

<p>Now, it was a warm day, and, as Uncle
Wiggily felt tired, he sat down in a shady
place in the fields, and soon fell fast asleep.
And, no sooner was he in Dreamland than
along came Mr. Spider.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" said the spider. "Now's my
chance to catch this bunny for the alligator.
I'll spin a strong web around him, so strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
that he cannot break loose. Then I'll go get
my friend, the 'gator."</p>

<p>So while Uncle Wiggily slept, Mr. Spider
spun a strong web about the bunny&mdash;a very
extra strong web, with such big strands that
Uncle Wiggily never could have broken them
himself. And when the web was all finished,
and the bunny was helpless, he awakened
just as Mr. Spider was going off to call Mr.
Alligator.</p>

<p>"Oh, what has happened to me?" cried the
bunny, as he found he could not move his
paws or even twinkle his pink nose. "Oh,
what is it? Let me go!"</p>

<p>"No, you can't go!" said the spider. "You
are going to stay there until I bring Mr. Alligator,"
and away he crawled. Uncle
Wiggily tried to get loose, but he could not.</p>

<p>"Oh, if only some one would come who's
good and strong, and would cut this web,
then I would be free!" said the bunny.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, out from behind
the bush came the Four and Twenty Tailors,
from Mother Goose. They had their big scissors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
with them, and they were led by Alice of
Wonderland.</p>

<p>"I told these silly tailors I'd help them hunt
the snail, because they are so timid that they
even fear her tail," laughed Alice, "but we'll
stop and help you first, dear Uncle Wiggily!"</p>

<p>Then the Four and Twenty Tailors, with
their shears, sniped and snapped the strong
spider's web until it was all in pieces and the
bunny could easily get loose. And when the
alligator, fetched by the spider, came to get
the bunny he wasn't there.</p>

<p>But the strong-billed Lory bird was there.
He had heard about Uncle Wiggily's
trouble from the Do-do bird, and had come,
with his strong bill, to bite the spider web
into little pieces.</p>

<p>"But I am too late, I see," said the Lory.
"The Mother Goose Tailors got here first.
However, as I want to bite something hard
and mean I'll bite the alligator." And he did
and the alligator said "Ouch!" and I'm glad
of it.</p>

<p>And if the telephone bell doesn't ring at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
front door and make believe it's the milkman
looking for old rags, I'll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and the puppy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE PUPPY</span></h2>


<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Oh, Uncle Wiggily!
Oh, Uncle Wiggily!" called Jackie and Peetie
Bow Wow, the two doggie boys, as they ran
barking up to the hollow stump bungalow
one morning.</p>

<p>"Well, well! What's the matter now?"
asked Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit
gentleman, as he came out on the porch.</p>

<p>"Oh, we've got a baby over at our house!"
cried Jackie.</p>

<p>"Come and see it!" barked Peetie.</p>

<p>"A baby? At your house?" exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Well, a little puppy dog," said Jackie.
"That's the same to us as a real baby is to
real persons."</p>

<p>"To be sure," agreed the bunny uncle. "I'll
come over and see the new baby puppy," and
putting on his tall silk hat, and taking down
his red-white-and-blue-striped barber pole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
rheumatism crutch from the electric light,
Mr. Longears started away over the fields to
the kennel house, where the Bow Wow dog
family lived.</p>

<p>"There's the new baby puppy!" cried
Jackie, as he poked away the straw from the
bed where something was moving about.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;why, bless my spectacles&mdash;I can hardly
see him!" said Uncle Wiggily, taking off his
glasses to polish them, for he thought maybe
he had splashed some carrot oatmeal on
them at breakfast and that they were clouded
over.</p>

<p>"He's so small, that's why you can't see
him," spoke Peetie. "But he'll soon grow big
like us, Uncle Wiggily."</p>

<p>"Let us hope so," spoke the bunny uncle.
"He's so small now I'd be afraid of stepping
on him if I lived here."</p>

<p>"He's got awful cute eyes," said Peetie.
"They aren't open yet, but I can pull 'em
apart a little bit to show you they're going to
be blue color, I guess," and Peetie began
opening the shut eyes of his little baby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
brother puppy. Of course, the puppy whined
and Mrs. Bow Wow called:</p>

<p>"Now, what are you boys doing to that
baby?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, ma," answered Jackie.</p>

<p>"We're jest pokin' open his eyes so Uncle
Wiggily can see 'em," answered Peetie.</p>

<p>"Oh, you doggie boys!" cried Mrs. Bow
Wow. "You mustn't do that! I'm glad Uncle
Wiggily came to see our baby, but now you
run out and play, Peetie and Jackie, while I
visit with Mr. Longears."</p>

<p>So the doggie boys ran out to play with
Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the squirrels,
and Mrs. Bow Wow told Uncle Wiggily what
a nice baby Wuff-Wuff was. Wuff-Wuff was
the new puppy's name.</p>

<p>"I'm sure he'll grow up to be a fine dog,"
said the bunny. Just then the telephone bell
in the kennel house rang, and when Mrs.
Bow Wow answered she said, after listening
awhile:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! This is your friend Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy talking to me. She wants me
to come over to show her how to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
strawberry longcake, as there is a lot of company
coming for supper. A short cake won't
be large enough."</p>

<p>"Are you going to my hollow stump bungalow?"
asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"I'd like to, only I can't leave Baby Wuff
Wuff," said Mrs. Bow Wow.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll stay and take care of him," said
the bunny uncle. "I think I can do it, and it
may be an adventure for me. Trot along,
Mrs. Bow Wow."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will. If Wuff Wuff gets hungry,
just give him some milk from this bottle,"
and she handed a nursing one to Uncle
Wiggily. So Mrs. Bow Wow went over to
help Nurse Jane, the muskrat lady housekeeper,
make the longcake, and the bunny
man stayed with the puppy baby.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily sat in the kennel house,
while the little doggie nestled in the straw.
The bunny rabbit was just wondering who
the company could be that were coming to
his bungalow, when, all of a sudden, there
was a big noise outside the kennel, and a big
voice cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now I know you're in there, Uncle Wiggily,
for I saw you hop in with Jackie and
Peetie. And I know they're gone, for I saw
them go out. And I know Mrs. Bow Wow is
out. So you're there all alone and I'm going
to get you!" And Uncle Wiggily saw the big
skillery-scalery alligator standing outside
the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" thought the bunny rabbit gentleman.
"He'll surely get me this time, for
he can knock the kennel house apart with one
flip-flap of his double-jointed tail. But maybe,
if I keep real still, he will think I'm gone."</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily snuggled down in the
straw with the baby puppy, but the alligator
cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you're there, and I'm going to
get you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, if only this puppy was a big, strong
dog, like Nero!" thought Uncle Wiggily, "he
could save me from the alligator." Just then
the puppy began to whine, and the bunny
rabbit said:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't do that, Wuff Wuff! Don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
whine, and make a noise, or the alligator will
get you, too."</p>

<p>But the puppy baby still whined, for he
was hungry. Uncle Wiggily picked up a bottle
and put the end of it in Wuff Wuff's
mouth.</p>

<p>"Here, drink that," said the bunny. "Then
you won't be hungry." The puppy baby did
so, and then something very strange happened.
The little puppy suddenly began
growing very large. First he was the size of
Mr. Bow Wow, and then he swelled up until
he was as big as a horse, and had to get out of
the kennel house for fear of bursting off the
roof.</p>

<p>And when the alligator saw the great big
puppy dog, like the one in Alice of Wonderland,
suddenly standing in front of him, Mr.
'Gator just gave one flip of his tail, and away
he ran crying:</p>

<p>"Oh, my! I didn't know an elephant was
there to save Uncle Wiggily!"</p>

<p>But there wasn't. It was only the puppy
who had suddenly grown big. For by mistake
instead of giving him the bottle of milk, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
bunny rabbit gave him some of the water
from the magical red-stoppered, big-growing
bottle that Alice from Wonderland had
sent the bunny. It had been mended after
the croquet ball broke it. And, after the
puppy had scared away the alligator, Uncle
Wiggily gave Wuff Wuff some water from
the magical blue-stoppered bottle and shrunk
him to his regular baby size, and everybody
was happy.</p>

<p>And if the fairy tale doesn't waggle itself
all around the book case and scare all the big
words out of the dictionary, I'll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and the Unicorn.</p>

<p>"Well, you look just as if you were going
somewhere, Uncle Wiggily," said Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper,
as the rabbit gentleman whizzed around the
corner of his hollow stump bungalow in his
automobile, with the bologna sausage tires,
one morning.</p>

<p>"I am going somewhere," he answered, and
really he was, for the wheels were whizzing
around like anything.</p>

<p>"And going where, may I ask?" politely inquired
the muskrat lady.</p>

<p>"I am going to give Alice a ride," answered
Uncle Wiggily. "Alice from Wonderland, I
mean. She never has ridden in an automobile."</p>

<p>"She never has?" cried Nurse Jane, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Never! You see, when she was put in that
nice book, which tells so much about her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
there weren't any autos, and, of course, she
never could have had a ride in one.</p>

<p>"But she had ever so many other nice adventures,
such as going down the rabbit hole
and through the looking glass. However, I
promised her a ride in my auto, and here I go
to give it to her," and with that Uncle Wiggily
sprinkled some pepper and salt on the
sausage tires of his auto's wheels to make
them go faster.</p>

<p>The rabbit gentleman found Alice, the little
book girl, in the White Queen's garden
having a make-believe tea party with the
Mock Turtle, who soon would have to go into
the 5 o'clock soup.</p>

<p>"Oh, how kind of you to come for me, Uncle
Wiggily!" cried Alice, and she jumped up so
quickly that she overturned the multiplication
table, at which she and the Mock Turtle
had been sitting, and ran to jump in the auto.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't call that very nice," said the
Mock Turtle. "Here she's gone and mixed
up the seven times table with the three times
six, and goodness knows when I'll ever get
them straightened out again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sorry!" called Alice, waving her hand
as she rode off with Uncle Wiggily. "I'll help
you when I come back."</p>

<p>"And I'll help too," promised the bunny
uncle.</p>

<p>Mr. Longears and Wonderland Alice rode
over the fields and through the woods, and
they were having a fine time when, all of a
sudden, as the automobile came near a place
where some oak trees grew in a thick cluster
Alice cried:</p>

<p>"Hark! They're fighting!"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Uncle Wiggily. "Please
don't tell me it is the mosquito enemy coming
after me to bite me."</p>

<p>"No, it's the Lion and the Unicorn," Alice
answered. "Don't you remember how it goes
in my book:</p>

<p class="poem">
"'The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the Crown,<br />
&nbsp; The Lion beat the Unicorn all around the town.<br />
&nbsp; Some gave them white bread, some gave them brown,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>&nbsp; And then the funny Unicorn jumped right up and down.'<br />
</p>

<p>"That last line isn't just right," explained
Alice to the bunny uncle, "but I couldn't properly
think of it, I'm so frightened!"</p>

<p>"Frightened? At what" asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"At the Unicorn," answered Alice. "Here
he comes," and, as she said that, Uncle Wiggily
saw a funny animal, like a horse, with a
big long horn sticking out of the middle of
his head, straight in front of him, galloping
out of the clump of trees.</p>

<p>"Hurray! I beat him!" cried the Unicorn.
"Come on now, quick, I must get away from
here before they catch me!"</p>

<p>"You beat him? Do you mean beat the
Lion?" asked Uncle Wiggily for he was not
frightened as was Alice.</p>

<p>"Sure I beat him," answered the Unicorn,
as he jumped into the back seat of the automobile.
"Drive on!" he ordered just as if
the bunny uncle gentleman were the coachman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you beat him very hard, with a broomstick?"
asked Alice, putting out her head
from behind Uncle Wiggily's tall silk hat
where she had hidden herself.</p>

<p>"Beat him with a broomstick? Ha! Ha! I
should say not!" laughed the Unicorn. "We're
too jolly good friends for that," and he spoke
like an English chap. "I beat him playing
hop-Scotch and Jack-straws. I was two hops
and three straws ahead of him when I stopped
and ran away because they were after me."</p>

<p>"Who were after you?" asked Alice. "The
lion's friends?"</p>

<p>"No, the straws that show which way the
wind blows. When the wind blows the
straws against me they tickle, and I can't
bear to be tickled. I'm worse than a soap
bubble that way. So I ran to get in the auto.
I hope you don't mind," and the Unicorn
leaned back on the seat cushions.</p>

<p>"Mind? Not in the least!" cried Uncle
Wiggily. "I'm glad to give you a ride with
Alice," and he made the auto go very fast.
On and on they went, over the fields and
through the woods and then, all of a sudden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
out from behind a tree jumped the big skillery-scalery
alligator walking on his hind
legs and the end of his double-jointed tail.</p>

<p>"Halt!" he cried, like a sentry soldier, and
Uncle Wiggily stopped the auto. "At last I
have caught you," said the alligator in a nutmeg
grater sort of a voice. "I want you,
Uncle Wiggily, and that Alice girl also. As
for your friend in the back seat, he may go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, may I? Thank you!" cried the Unicorn,
and with that he leaned forward. And,
as he did so the long sharp horn in his head
reached over Uncle Wiggily's shoulder, and
began to tickle the alligator right under his
soft ribs.</p>

<p>"Oh, stop! Stop it, I tell you!" giggled the
'gator. "Stop tickling me!" and he laughed
and wiggled and squirmed like an angle worm
going fishing.</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" he begged.</p>

<p>"I will when you let my friends, Uncle
Wiggily and Alice, alone," said the Unicorn,
still tickling away.</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! I'll let them alone," promised
the alligator, and he laughed until the tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
ran down his tail. And then he had to run off
by himself through the woods, and so he
didn't get the bunny uncle nor Wonderland
Alice either. And he never could have gotten
the Unicorn, because of his long, ticklish
horn.</p>

<p>So it is sometimes a good thing to take one
of these stickery chaps along when you go
for an automobile ride. And if the skyrocket
doesn't fall down and stub its nose when it
tries to jump over the moon with the crumpled
horn cow, I'll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and Humpty Dumpty.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND HUMPTY DUMPTY</span></h2>


<p>"Excuse me," spoke a gentle voice behind
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady
housekeeper, who was cleaning the steps of
the hollow stump bungalow one morning.
"Excuse me, but can Uncle Wiggily be out to
play?"</p>

<p>"Be out to play?" repeated Nurse Jane.
"Do you mean play with you?" and the muskrat
lady turned to see a little girl, with flaxen
hair, standing at the foot of the steps.</p>

<p>"Yes, play with me, if you please," said the
little girl. "I'm Alice from Wonderland, you
know, and Uncle Wiggily and I had such a
jolly time yesterday, when the Unicorn
tickled the alligator and made him laugh,
that I'd like to go off with him again."</p>

<p>"With whom&mdash;the alligator?" asked Nurse
Jane.</p>

<p>"No, with Uncle Wiggily," laughed Alice.
"Where is he?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here I am, Alice. I've just finished breakfast,"
answered the bunny rabbit gentleman
himself, as he came out on the front bungalow
steps. "Are you ready for another auto
ride?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I am, thank you. And as tomorrow
is a holiday I don't have any school
today."</p>

<p>"That's funny," said Uncle Wiggily,
twinkling his pink nose. "What holiday is
it?"</p>

<p>"The Fourth of July!" answered Alice.
"Have you forgotten? Even though I am an
English girl I know what it means. Your
boys and girls shoot off lollypops, bang ice
cream cones and light red, white and blue
candy."</p>

<p>"Candy? I guess you mean candles!"
laughed Uncle Wiggily. "However, you're
right. It is the Fourth of July tomorrow, and
whereas, years ago, we used to shoot off firecrackers
(when many children were burned),
now we have a nicer holiday.</p>

<p>"We go off in the woods and gather flowers.
Why, do you know!" cried the bunny uncle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
"there are flowers just right for Fourth of
July. There are puff balls that are as good as
torpedoes, and snap-dragons that open their
mouths and make believe bite you, and there
are dogwood flowers that bark, and red sumach
which is just the color of firecrackers."</p>

<p>"Then let's go off in the woods and have
Fourth of July there," proposed Alice, and
soon she and the bunny uncle were in the
automobile. And then along came Sammie
and Susie Littletail, the rabbit children, and
Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the squirrels,
and Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the puppy
dogs.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily!" cried these animal
boys and girls. "Take us with you for Fourth
of July!"</p>

<p>"Of course I shall!" promised the bunny
gentleman, so they all got in the automobile
with him and Wonderland Alice, and away
they went.</p>

<p>They had not gone very far before, all of a
sudden, they came to a stone wall, and when
Alice saw something on top of it, she cried:</p>

<p>"Why, there's my old friend Humpty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Dumpty. I must stop and speak to him or
he'll think I'm proud," and she waved her
hands.</p>

<p>"Why, that&mdash;that's nothing but an&mdash;egg!"
said Sammie. "It's like the ones I colored for
Easter when the skilli-gimink dye splashed
all over me. That isn't Humpty Dumpty at
all&mdash;it's an egg!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Susie. "Humpty
Dumpty is an egg, of course, but he doesn't
like to be told of it. Don't you know the little
verse?</p>

<p class="poem">
"'Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall,<br />
&nbsp; Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.<br />
&nbsp; All the King's horses and all the King's men<br />
&nbsp; Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty together again.'"
</p>

<p>"That's right," said Alice from Wonderland.
"Only don't speak of the fall before
Humpty. He doesn't like to be reminded of
it."</p>

<p>"I don't see why," spoke Jackie Bow Wow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
"He can't hear a word we say. He's only an
egg&mdash;he hasn't any ears."</p>

<p>"He really isn't dressed yet," said Alice.
"It's a bit early. But I'll soon make him look
more human."</p>

<p>With that she jumped out of the auto and,
taking two ears of corn from a field nearby,
she fastened them with silk from the cob, one
on each side of the egg.</p>

<p>"Now he can hear," said Alice. Then with
tulip flowers she made Humpty a mouth and
from a potato she took two eyes, so the egg
could see. A comb made him as nice teeth as
one could wish for, and they never ached, and
for a nose she took out a cute little bottle of
perfumery.</p>

<p>"I think that's a queer nose," said Johnnie
Bushytail, frisking his tail.</p>

<p>"Well, a bottle of perfumery smells,
doesn't it?" asked Alice, "and that's what a
nose is especially for; smells."</p>

<p>"Indeed it is!" cried Humpty Dumpty in his
jolly voice, speaking through the tulips. "I'm
all made now. I only hope&mdash;" And then he
suddenly turned pale, for he nearly fell off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the wall. "Has any one any powder?" he
asked. "I think I'd like to clean my teeth."</p>

<p>"I have some talcum," spoke Lulu Wibblewobble,
the duck girl, coming along just then.</p>

<p>"That will do," spoke Humpty Dumpty. "It
will be just fine." And with a brush made
from the end of a soft fern he began to clean
his teeth with the talcum powder which Lulu
gave him.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, there was a loud
noise, a puff of smoke, and Humpty Dumpty,
the egg man, was seen sailing off through
the air like a big white balloon.</p>

<p>"Well, this is better than falling off the
wall!" he cried in a faint voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, my! What happened?" asked Sammie
Littletail, trying to make his pink nose
twinkle as Uncle Wiggily did his.</p>

<p>"Humpty Dumpty was blown up instead of
falling down," said Alice. "I guess your talcum
powder was too strong for him, Lulu, my
dear. And it being the Fourth of July tomorrow,
Humpty wanted to give us some fireworks.
So he's gone, but I'm glad he wasn't
broken, for if he was the way the book has it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
when he falls off the wall, all the King's
horses and all the King's men couldn't put
him together again. Maybe it is best as it
is."</p>

<p>But, after a while Humpty Dumpty sailed
back again, not hurt a bit, and he sat on the
wall as well as ever.</p>

<p>Then Alice and Uncle Wiggily and the animal
boys and girls had fun in the woods. And,
if the pink pills don't hide in the green bottle
and pretend they're peppermint candy for
the rag doll, I'll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the looking glass.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LOOKING GLASS</span></h2>


<p>"A package came for you while you were
out adventuring today," said Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper,
to Uncle Wiggily Longears, the bunny rabbit
gentleman, as he hopped down the stairs
of the hollow stump bungalow to breakfast
one morning.</p>

<p>"I wonder what's in it?" asked the bunny
as he put a slice of carrot jam on his bread
and held it over the lettuce coffee to have it
flavored.</p>

<p>"I don't know. You'll have to open it to
find out," answered Nurse Jane. "It is
marked 'Glass. With Care.'"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily was so eager and excited
like that he could not wait to finish his breakfast,
but quickly opened the package which
Mr. Hummingbird, the lightning express
messenger, had left at the bungalow early
that morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a looking glass!" exclaimed the bunny
uncle when he saw what it was. "And it's
from Alice in Wonderland&mdash;at least she used
to live in Wonderland before she came to
Woodland to have adventures with me."</p>

<p>"And there's a note with it," spoke Nurse
Jane, as she saw a piece of white birch bark,
with writing on it; the letters having been
made with a burned stick which marks black
like a lead pencil.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a little letter," said Uncle Wiggily
as he read it. "And it's from Alice. It
says: 'Dear Uncle Wiggily: I send you the
Looking Glass I once went through, and on
the other side I had many adventures. I wish
you the same!'"</p>

<p>"That's queer," said the bunny, as he
turned the glass over and looked at the back.
"I don't see any hole where Alice went
through."</p>

<p>"Maybe it closed up after her, the same as
fairy doors always close once you pass
through," explained Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>"I believe you are right," said Uncle Wiggily.
"But this is a very small glass for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
girl like Alice to get through," and indeed
the glass was one of the kind you hold in your
hand.</p>

<p>"Maybe the glass was larger when Alice
went through it," said Nurse Jane, "or else
perhaps she had taken some drops from the
magic bottle and grew small like a rubber
doll."</p>

<p>"I guess that was it," agreed Uncle Wiggily.
"Anyhow, it is very kind of her to send
me the looking glass. I may have an adventure
with it. I'll take it out on the front
steps and then we'll see what happens next."</p>

<p>So, having finished his breakfast, the
bunny went out on the bungalow porch and
sat with the looking glass in his paw, waiting
for something to happen.</p>

<p>He sat there and sat there and sat there
and he was just beginning to wonder if anything
would happen, when, all of a sudden,
there was a rustling in the bushes, and up
on the porch popped a bad old skillery-scalery
alligator, with bumps all down the middle
of his back like the buttons on a lady's
dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, ha! I am just in time, I see!" exclaimed
the 'gator.</p>

<p>"For what?" asked Uncle Wiggily, suddenly
awakening, for he had fallen into a
little sleep while he waited for an adventure
to happen with the looking glass. "In time
for what?"</p>

<p>"To go away with you," answered the alligator.</p>

<p>"But I am not going away," said the
bunny. "At least I did not know I was going,"
and he looked around rather sad and
lonesome, for he did not like the bad alligator,
and he wanted to see, Uncle Wiggily
did, if brave Nurse Jane Fuzzy would not
come out and throw cold water on him&mdash;on
the alligator, I mean&mdash;to drive him away.
But the muskrat lady had gone to the store
to get some cheese for supper.</p>

<p>"I am not going away," said Uncle Wiggily
again.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes you are!" exclaimed the alligator,
and he smiled in such a way that it seemed
as though the whole top of his head would
pop off, so large was the smile. "You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
not know it, but you are going away, Uncle
Wiggily."</p>

<p>"With whom?" asked the bunny.</p>

<p>"With me," answered the 'gator. "We are
going away together. I came on purpose to
fetch you. Come along," and with that the
bad alligator wound his double-jointed tail
around the bunny uncle's ears, lifted him out
of the rocking chair and started to walk off
the bungalow porch with him.</p>

<p>"Oh, stop it!" cried Uncle Wiggily. "Let
me go! Let me go!"</p>

<p>"No! No!" barked the alligator, like a dog.
"I'll not let you go, now I have you!" and he
started to drag the bunny uncle off to the
dark, damp, dismal swamp, where the mosquitoes
lived with the tent caterpillars.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't take me away!" begged
the bunny. "I wish some one would help
me!" and as he said that the alligator gave
him a sudden twist and the looking glass,
which Uncle Wiggily still held in his paw,
came around in front of the alligator's face.</p>

<p>And, no sooner had the 'gator looked in the
glass than he gave a loud cry, and, unwinding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
his tail from Uncle Wiggily, away the bad
creature scurried, leaving the bunny alone
and safe. And the alligator cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse me! I didn't mean anything!
I'll be good! I won't hurt Uncle Wiggily!"</p>

<p>"Well, I wonder what frightened him
away?" asked Uncle Wiggily, out loud.</p>

<p>"Seeing himself in the looking glass," was
the answer, and there stood Alice from Wonderland.
"That is a magical mirror I sent
you, Uncle Wiggily," she explained. "It
shows the reflection of anything and anybody
just as they are and not as they'd like to be.</p>

<p>"And the alligator is such a mean-looking
and ugly chap, that, never before having seen
himself, this time when he did, in the looking
glass, he was frightened, seeing himself as
others see him. He thought he was looking
at a Chinese dragon who would bite him. So
he ran away, leaving you alone."</p>

<p>"And I'm so glad he did," said Uncle Wiggily.
"It's a good thing I had your looking
glass."</p>

<p>Then Alice and Uncle Wiggily had a good
time, and if the clothes pin doesn't pinch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
pillow case so hard that it tickles the bedspread
and makes it sneeze all the feathers
out, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
the White Queen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE WHITE QUEEN</span></h2>


<p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice rabbit
gentleman, was hopping along through the
woods one day, wondering if he would have
an adventure with Alice of Wonderland or
some of her friends, when, all of a sudden,
coming to a place where a rail fence ran
along among the trees he saw, caught in a
crack of one of the rails by its legs, a white
butterfly.</p>

<p>The poor butterfly was fluttering its wings,
trying to pull out its legs, but it had to pull
very gently, for a butterfly's leg, you know, is
very tender and easily broken, like a piece of
spider-web.</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" cried kind Uncle Wiggily, when
he saw what was the matter. "You are in
trouble, aren't you? I'm glad I happened to
come along."</p>

<p>"Why are you glad; to see me in trouble?"
asked the white butterfly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, indeed!" exclaimed the bunny uncle.
"But I want to help you."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you would," went on the fluttering
creature. "I've tried and tried again
to get my poor leg loose, but I can't. And I'm
on my way&mdash;oh, but I forgot. That part is a
secret!" quickly said the butterfly.</p>

<p>"Well, then, don't tell me," spoke Uncle
Wiggily with a laugh, "for I might not be
very good at keeping secrets. But I'll soon
have your leg loose."</p>

<p>With that he took the small end of his red,
white and blue striped rheumatism crutch
that Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy had gnawed
for him out of a cornstalk and putting the little
end of his crutch in the crack of the rail
fence, Uncle Wiggily gave a hard push,
opened the crack wider, and soon the butterfly's
leg was loose and she could fly away.</p>

<p>"But first I must thank you, Uncle Wiggily,"
she said. "And as you did me so great
a favor I want to do you one in return. Not
now, perhaps, as I am in a hurry, but later.
So if ever you find you want something you
can't get, just come to these woods and say a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
little verse. Then you shall have your wish."</p>

<p>"What verse shall I say?" asked Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>"This," answered the butterfly. Then she
recited:</p>

<p class="poem">
"When the wind blows in the trees,<br />
&nbsp;Making perfume for the breeze,<br />
&nbsp;Will you grant to me this boon,<br />
&nbsp;That my wish may come true soon?"
</p>

<p>"And what then?" asked the bunny.</p>

<p>"Then," answered the butterfly, "you must
whisper your wish to a green leaf and&mdash;well,
we'll see what happens next."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Uncle Wiggily, and then
he hopped on through the woods while the
butterfly fluttered away.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily had no adventure that day,
but when he reached home to his hollow
stump bungalow he found his muskrat lady
housekeeper in the kitchen looking quite sad
and blue.</p>

<p>"Well, Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy!" cried the
jolly bunny uncle. "Whatever is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have broken my nice gold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
diamond dishpan, and I can't do any more
kitchen work until it is mended. I can't wash
the dishes nor get you any supper."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind about that," said Uncle
Wiggily. "I'll take the diamond dishpan
down to the five and ten cent store and have
them mend it for you. Where is it?"</p>

<p>Nurse Jane gave it to him. The pan had a
big crack right across the middle. The muskrat
lady said it had fallen to the floor and had
broken when she went to get Jackie Bow
Wow, the little puppy dog boy a slice of bread
and jam.</p>

<p>"I'll soon have it fixed for you," said Uncle
Wiggily. But it was more easily said than
done. The five and ten cent store was closed
because every one was on a picnic, and no one
else could mend the dishpan.</p>

<p>"Never mind, I'll buy Nurse Jane a new
one and say nothing about it," said Uncle
Wiggily. "I'll surprise her."</p>

<p>But this, too, was more easily said than
done. In all Woodland, where Uncle Wiggily
and the animal folk lived, there was not another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
gold and diamond dishpan to be had.
They were all sold.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! What shall I do?" thought
Uncle Wiggily. "Nurse Jane will be so unhappy!"
Then he happened to think of the
white butterfly and what she had told him.
So, taking the dishpan, he went to the wood
where he had helped the fluttering creature
and whispered to a leaf the little verse:</p>

<p class="poem">
"When the wind blows in the trees,<br />
&nbsp;Making perfume for the breeze,<br />
&nbsp;Will you grant to me this boon,<br />
&nbsp;That my wish may come true soon?"
</p>

<p>"Well, what is your wish?" asked a sudden
voice.</p>

<p>"I wish Nurse Jane's gold and diamond
dishpan to be mended," said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>Instantly something white came fluttering
down out of a tree, and the bunny saw it was
the white butterfly. And then, all of a sudden,
before he could count up to sixteen thousand,
the white butterfly seemed to fade
away and in its place was a beautiful White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Queen, seated on a golden throne with a
diamond crown on her head.</p>

<p>"You shall have your wish, Uncle Wiggily,"
she said. "Give me the dishpan."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why!" exclaimed the bunny. "You
are&mdash;you are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am the White Queen from Alice in Wonderland,"
was the answer, "and I will ask
you a riddle. When you take the dishes out
of the pan what remains?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered the bunny.</p>

<p>"Wrong," answered the White Queen.
"The water does. Now I'll mend this for
you." And she did, taking some gold from
her throne and some diamonds from her
crown to mend the broken dishpan.</p>

<p>Soon Nurse Jane's pan was as good as ever
and she could wash the dishes in it.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Uncle Wiggily. "But
how is it you are a queen and a butterfly,
too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we Queens lead a sort of butterfly existence,"
said the White Queen. "But I must
go now, for I have to find the tarts for the
Queen of Hearts who is always losing hers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, changing herself into a white butterfly
again, the Queen flew away, and Uncle
Wiggily, with the mended dishpan, hopped
on to his hollow stump bungalow, where he
and Nurse Jane were soon having a nice
supper and were very happy.</p>

<p>And if the potato masher doesn't go to the
moving pictures and step on the toes of the
egg beater I'll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the Red Queen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE RED QUEEN</span></h2>


<p>Once upon a time, when Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman, was out
walking in the woods, he stopped beside a
little hole in the ground near a pile of oak
tree leaves, and listening, when the wind
stopped blowing, he heard a little voice
saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, but where can she be? I fear she is
lost! Little Crawlie is lost!"</p>

<p>"My! That's too bad," thought Uncle Wiggily.
"Somebody's little girl is lost. I must
ask if I cannot help find her." So he called:</p>

<p>"Oh, ho, there! May I have the pleasure of
helping you in your trouble, whoever you
are?"</p>

<p>"But who are you?" asked a voice that
seemed to come out of the little hole in the
ground.</p>

<p>"I am Uncle Wiggily Longears," answered
the bunny. "You can easily see me, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
can't see you. And who is this Crawlie who is
lost?"</p>

<p>"She is my little girl," was the answer, and
up the hole in the ground came crawling a red
ant lady, who was crying tear drops about as
large as that part of a pin point which you
can't see but can only feel.</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. "I
couldn't imagine who would live in such a
little house, but of course ants can. And now
what about Crawlie?"</p>

<p>"She is my little girl," answered the red
ant. "I sent her to the store about an hour
ago to get a loaf of sand bread, but she hasn't
come back and I'm sure something has happened
to her."</p>

<p>"Let us hope not," spoke Uncle Wiggily,
softly. "I'll go at once and look for her.
Have no fear, Mrs. Ant. I'll find Crawlie for
you. It is rather a queer name."</p>

<p>"Crawlie is called that because she crawls
in such a funny way," said Mrs. Ant. "Oh,
dear! I hope she is all right. If she should
happen to have fallen down a crack in a peach
stone she'd never get out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll find her," said Uncle Wiggily, bravely.</p>

<p>So off started the bunny uncle, hopping on
his red, white and blue striped rheumatism
crutch over the fields and through the woods,
looking for Crawlie.</p>

<p>He had not gone very far before he heard
a small voice calling:</p>

<p>"Help! Help! Oh, will no one help me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, I will!" answered the
bunny, and then he saw an acorn which
seemed to be moving along the ground in a
queer way.</p>

<p>"Ha! Can it be that this acorn is alive?"
asked Uncle Wiggily. "And can that acorn
want help?" he cried.</p>

<p>"No, it is I&mdash;Crawlie, the ant girl&mdash;under
the acorn," was the answer, "and I want help,
for I'm in such trouble."</p>

<p>"What kind?" asked Uncle Wiggily.
"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'm caught under this acorn here
and I can't get out," was the answer, and
Crawlie's voice sounded as though she had
gone down cellar to get a crumb of apple and
couldn't find her way back again. "I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
under the acorn shell, which is empty," said
the little ant girl, "and though it was nicely
propped up on one side when I crawled in, it
was blown over by the wind and I was held
beneath it. Oh, dear! I can't get out and go
to the store for the loaf of sand bread!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes you can!" cried jolly Uncle Wiggily.
"I'll lift the acorn shell off you and let
you out."</p>

<p>So he did, easily picking up the empty oak
tree acorn from where it was covering
Crawlie, and then the little ant girl, who was
red, just like her mother, could walk about.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Uncle Wiggily," she said.
"If ever we ants can do you a favor we will."</p>

<p>"Oh, pray do not mention it," spoke Uncle
Wiggily, modest-like and shy. Then Crawlie
hurried on to the sand bread store and the
bunny hopped along over the fields and
through the woods.</p>

<p>He had not gone very far before he met a
poor old June bug gentleman, and the June
bug seemed very sad and unhappy.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lots," was the answer. "You see it is now
time, being July, for June bugs like myself
to get in their winter wood so we will not
freeze in the cold weather. But I hurt my
legs, banging into an electric light one night,
and I'm so lame and stiff that I can't gather
any wood at all. I shall freeze, I know I
shall!" and the June bug gentleman was
more sad than ever.</p>

<p>"Oh, cheer up!" cried Uncle Wiggily.
"There is plenty of wood under these trees.
I'll help you gather it."</p>

<p>"There is no need to do that," said another
voice, and, looking up, Uncle Wiggily and the
June bug saw, sitting on a green mossy log,
a Red Queen wearing a golden crown.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 270px;">
<a href="images/159.png"><img src="images/th_159.png" width="270" height="400" alt="Uncle Wiggily and the Queen of Hearts" title="Uncle Wiggily and the Queen of Hearts" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily in surprise.
"You are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am the Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland,"
interrupted the lady on the log. "I
was also the red ant lady who was crying and
also Crawlie, the red ant girl. You were so
kind to me when you thought I was only a
crawling insect that now, when I have
changed myself into a Red Queen, I want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
help you. And I know I can best help you by
helping this June bug friend of yours."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you can!" said Uncle Wiggily,
thankful like.</p>

<p>"I thought so," spoke the Red Queen.
"Watch!"</p>

<p>With that she waved her magic wand, and,
instantly, ten million red, white and black
ants came crawling out of old logs from holes
in the ground and from under piles of leaves,
and each ant took up a little stick of wood
and carried it into the June bug's house for
him, so he had plenty of wood for all winter,
and couldn't freeze.</p>

<p>"There you are, Uncle Wiggily!" laughed
the Red Queen. "One kindness, you see,
makes another," and then she got in her
golden chariot and drove away, and when the
June bug gentleman had thanked him, and
the ants had crawled home, the bunny himself
went to his hollow stump bungalow very
happy.</p>

<p>And if the looking glass doesn't make faces
at the hairbrush and knock the teeth out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>

talcum powder, I'll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and Tweedledum.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND TWEEDLEDUM</span></h2>


<p>"Are you in, Uncle Wiggily?" asked a voice
at the hollow stump bungalow one morning,
and the rabbit gentleman looked up to see
Alice from Wonderland standing on the door
sill.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I'm in, my dear," he answered.
"Can't you see me?"</p>

<p>"I can't be sure of anything I see," answered
the little girl with flaxen hair, "especially
since I've been having so many queer
adventures. I used to think I saw the
Cheshire cat, when it was only his grin smiling
at me. And maybe now I'm only looking
at your ears, or tall silk hat, and thinking it's
you."</p>

<p>"No, I'm here all right," answered the
bunny. "Is there anything I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Alice. "I'd like you to
come for a walk with me. I haven't much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
longer time to stay with you, and I want to
have all the fun I can."</p>

<p>"Are you going away?" asked Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>"I have very soon to go back in the book
where I belong," answered Alice. "But no
matter. Come now, and we'll go look for an
adventure."</p>

<p>So Alice and Uncle Wiggily started off over
the fields and through the woods, and they
had not gone very far before they suddenly
heard, among the trees, some voices crying:</p>

<p>"You did it!"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did; you know you did!"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't! I know I didn't!"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to have a battle, anyhow!"</p>

<p>And then came a sound as if some one was
beating a carpet with a fishing pole and
voices cried:</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh, dear! Ouch! Oh, how it hurts!"</p>

<p>"My, what in the world can that be?" asked
Uncle Wiggily. "It sounds like an adventure
all right."</p>

<p>"I think it is," answered Alice. "It's probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Tweedledum and Tweedledee fighting."</p>

<p>"Fighting? Tweedledee and Tweedledum?"
asked the surprised bunny.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's only in fun," laughed Alice, "and
they have to do it because it's that way in the
book, for if they didn't things wouldn't come
out right. Yes, there they are." And she
pointed off through the trees, where Uncle
Wiggily saw two round, fat, little boys,
dressed exactly the same, and looking so
like one another that no one could tell them
apart, except when they were together&mdash;just
like twins, you know.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad to see you!" called Alice to
the two queer fat chaps. They were as round
as barrels, both of them. Uncle Wiggily noticed
that on the collar of one was the word
DUM, while on the other was the word DEE.</p>

<p>"Tweedle, the rest of their name, is on the
back of their collars," Alice explained. "As
it's the same for both, they didn't need it in
front."</p>

<p>Then the fat boys turned around, like tops
slowly spinning, and, surely enough, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
back of the white collar of each were letters
spelling TWEEDLE.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you," spoke Uncle Wiggily.
"I heard you&mdash;sort of&mdash;er&mdash;well, you
know," he went on, diffident-like, not wishing
to say he had heard the brothers quarreling.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right, we do that every day,"
said Tweedledee.</p>

<p>"And, contrariwise, twice on Sunday,"
added Tweedledum. "We have to for the
verse about us says:</p>

<p class="poem">
"'Tweedledum and Tweedledee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.4em;">Agreed to have a battle;</span><br />
&nbsp; For Tweedledum said Tweedledee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.4em;">Had spoiled his nice new rattle.</span><br />
<br />
"'Just then down flew a monstrous crow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.4em;">As black as a tar barrel,</span><br />
&nbsp; Which frightened both the heroes so,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.4em;">They quite forgot their quarrel.'"</span>
</p>

<p>"Only we weren't really frightened," said
Tweedledee. "We just made believe so, and
laughed at the crow. And I didn't really
spoil Tweedledum's nice new rattle, for here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
it is now," and taking his arm down from
around his brother's neck he took the rattle
from his pocket and shook it, making a noise
like a drum.</p>

<p>And, just as he did that, all of a sudden, out
from behind a big stump came&mdash;not a monstrous
crow, but the bad old skillery-scalery
alligator, who cried:</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! At last I have him! Now I'll get
that Uncle Wiggily Longears chap! Ah, ha!"
and he made a grab for the gentleman
bunny.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Alice. "Please don't
hurt Uncle Wiggily!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall!" snapped the 'gator. "I'll
bumble him and mumble him, that's what
I'll do."</p>

<p>"Oh, no you won't!" exclaimed Tweedledum,
wabbling toward the alligator as Jimmie
Wibblewobble, the boy duck, waddled
when he walked.</p>

<p>"I won't what?" asked the 'gator.</p>

<p>"You won't bumble or mumble Uncle Wiggily.
First you have to catch me!"</p>

<p>"Pooh! That's easily done," snapped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
alligator. "You are so fat that you can't run
any more than a rubber ball."</p>

<p>"Will you promise to let Uncle Wiggily
alone until you catch me?" asked Tweedledum,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I promise," said the alligator smiling to
himself, for he thought he could easily catch
the fat twin, and his promise wouldn't count.</p>

<p>"Then here I go! Catch me!" suddenly
cried Tweedledum. And with that he
stretched out on the ground and began to roll
down hill in the woods.</p>

<p>And as he was fat and round he rolled as
fast as a rubber ball, and he rolled so fast
(ever so much faster than if he had run) that
when the alligator raced after him, as he had
promised he would do, why the bad double-jointed
skillery-scalery creature got all out
of breath and couldn't bumble or mumble a
strawberry, to say nothing of Uncle Wiggily.
And the 'gator didn't catch the fat boy either.</p>

<p>So Tweedledum, rolling down hill that way,
which he could do much better than walking
or running, saved the bunny uncle from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
alligator, and Mr. Longears was very glad,
and so was Alice.</p>

<p>And if the knife and fork don't go to the
candy store, just when supper is ready, and
make the spoon holder wait for them before
eating the ice cream, I'll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and Tweedledee.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND TWEEDLEDEE</span></h2>


<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily!" cried a voice, as the
old rabbit gentleman started out from his
hollow stump bungalow one morning to walk
in the woods and look for an adventure. "Oh,
Uncle Wiggily, be careful!"</p>

<p>"Be careful of what, if you please, and who
are you, if I may ask?" politely inquired the
bunny.</p>

<p>"I am your friend Alice, from Wonderland,"
was the answer, "and I want you to be
careful and not get hurt today."</p>

<p>"I always am careful," answered Uncle
Wiggily. "I look for cabbage and turnip
traps wherever I go, and I never pick up a bit
of carrot on the Woodland path without first
making sure there is no string fast to it, to
catch me. What do you mean, Alice?" he
asked the little flaxen-haired girl as she came
out of the bushes and sat down on the stoop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of the hollow stump bungalow. "What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know just what I do mean, Uncle
Wiggily," said Alice. "But last night I
dreamed you were in trouble and I could not
help you. I felt so sorry! As soon as I woke
up this morning I hurried over to tell you to
be careful."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be careful," promised the bunny
gentleman. "But in your dream did no one
help me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, after a while two funny little fat
boys did," answered Alice. "But I don't remember
that part of my dream. However, if
you are going for a walk I'll go with you and
do what I can in case the Jabberwocky or the
Hop Scotch bird try to chase you."</p>

<p>"The Hop Scotch isn't a bird," said Uncle
Wiggily, with a laugh that made his pink
nose twinkle like the strawberry on top of a
cheese cake. "It's a bit of candy."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily! It's a game!" cried
Susie Littletail, the rabbit girl, coming out
from behind a stump just then. "It's a game
where you jump around on the pavement, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
if you and Alice are going to play it, please
may I watch you?"</p>

<p>"We aren't going to play," said Alice. "It's
long past play time."</p>

<p>"I am going to look for an adventure," said
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Then, please, may I come?" begged Susie.
"I'll help look."</p>

<p>"Come along!" cried jolly Uncle Wiggily
and soon the three of them were on their way
through the woods.</p>

<p>They had not gone very far, over the paths
with the big green ferns on either side, when,
all of a onceness out from behind a big log
jumped the two bad old skillery-scalery alligators,
one with the humps on his tail and the
other with his tail all double-jointed, so he
could wiggle it seven ways from Sunday.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" cried the hump-tailed 'gator.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" cried the double-jointed one. "At
last we have caught you!" and they both
made a grab for the rabbit gentleman, one
catching him on the left side and the other on
the right, and holding him fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Uncle Wiggily. "Oh, dear!
Please let me go!"</p>

<p>"No!" snapped the first 'gator. And "No!"
snapped the second, both flapping their tails.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is my dream! This is my dream!"
said Alice, sadly. "But where are the two fat
boys that saved Uncle Wiggily. Where are
they?"</p>

<p>"Here is one, if you please," answered a
voice, and out stepped Tweedledee, the queer
little fat chap from the Alice in Wonderland
book. "I'll help you, Uncle Wiggily."</p>

<p>"Thank you, very much," spoke the rabbit
gentleman. "If you would kindly make these
alligators let me go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh! Huh! Humph! What! Him make
us let you go? Well, I should say NOT!"
sniffed the first alligator.</p>

<p>"The very idea" sneered the second. "It
will take a great deal more than one fat boy
to make us let go of a nice, fat, juicy rabbit
once we have caught him. Certainly NOT!"</p>

<p>"Ahem! How about TWO fat boys?" suddenly
asked another voice, and there stood
another beside Tweedledee, a fat boy, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
looked just the same exactly; even as you
seem to yourself when you peek at your
reflection in the bath room mirror.</p>

<p>"No, we won't let you go for two fat boys,
either," said the double-jointed alligator,
while Alice murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh, this is my dream! This is my dream!
I wish I could remember how it came out!"</p>

<p>"Was Uncle Wiggily saved?" asked Susie
Littletail in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Then it's all right," spoke the rabbit girl.</p>

<p>"Let Uncle Wiggily go!" cried Tweedledee
in his most grown-up sort of voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, let him go at once!" added Tweedledum.</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" snapped both alligators together
like twins, only, of course, they
weren't.</p>

<p>"Well, then," went on Tweedledee, "don't
you dare to take away or hurt him unless you
guess which are our names. Now tell me truly
who am I? And, remember, if you don't guess
right, you can't have Uncle Wiggily!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are Tweedledum," said the hump-tailed
'gator.</p>

<p>"No, he is Tweedledee," said the other
'gator. "The one standing next to him is
Tweedledum. I guess I ought to know!"</p>

<p>"You're wrong," said the hump-tailed
'gator. "The one I saw first is Tweedledum.
I guess I ought to know!"</p>

<p>"I know better!" the double-jointed alligator
declared. "He is Tweedledee!"</p>

<p>"Tweedledum!" shouted the other 'gator.</p>

<p>"Tweedledee!" snapped his chum. And
then they both began disputing, calling each
other names, and throwing mud at one another,
until, finally, they were so mixed up
about Tweedledum and Tweedledee that they
let go of Uncle Wiggily and began shaking
their claws at one another, so the rabbit gentleman
and Alice and Susie (as well as the
two fat boys who looked exactly alike) ran
safely away and the bunny was saved, just as
Alice had dreamed.</p>

<p>"And to think, if the alligators had only
looked at our collars, they would have seen
our right names," Tweedledum laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," said Tweedledee.</p>

<p>But everything came out all right and the
alligators only had sawdust for supper. And
if the wash lady doesn't take my best collar
button to fasten the tablecloth to the ironing
board in the clothes basket, I'll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and the pool of tears.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br /><span class="small">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE TEAR POOL</span></h2>


<p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice rabbit
gentleman, was out walking in the woods one
day, wondering what sort of an adventure he
would have when he saw a little path, leading
away from his hollow stump bungalow, and
it seemed to go through a part of the forest
in which he had never before been.</p>

<p>"I'll take that path and see where it leads,"
said the bunny gentleman to himself.</p>

<p>So, taking a piece of ribbon grass, which
grew near a clump of ferns, he tied his tall
silk hat firmly on his head, leaving his ears
sticking out of the holes at the top, and tucking
under his paw his red, white and blue
striped barber pole rheumatism crutch that
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, his muskrat lady
housekeeper, had gnawed for him out of a
cornstalk, away started Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>It was a nice warm summer day, and before
the old gentleman bunny had gone very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
far he began to feel thirsty, just as you do
when you go on a picnic and eat pickles, only
I hope you don't eat too many of them.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there is not a spring of water
around here?" thought Uncle Wiggily, and
he began to look about under the low
branches of the trees and bushes, at the same
time listening for the laughing murmur of a
brook flowing over green, mossy stones.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Wiggily sniffed with his pink,
twinkling nose until it looked like a chicken
picking up corn.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" cried the bunny uncle, "I smell
water!" for you know animals and birds can
smell water when they cannot see it, in which
they are more gifted than are we.</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily sniffed and sniffed, and
then, holding his pink, twinkling nose
straight in front of him and letting it go on
ahead, instead of lagging behind, he followed
it until it led him straight to a little pool of
water that was sparkling in the sun, while
green moss ferns and bushes grew all
around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, what a fine spring!" cried the bunny,
"And how thirsty I am!"</p>

<p>Mr. Longears, which I call him when first I
introduce him to any strangers&mdash;Mr. Longears
was just going to take a long drink from
the pool, or spring, when he happened to notice
a little piece of white birch bark tied with
a bit of grass to a fern that grew near the
water.</p>

<p>"Ha! I wonder if that is a notice not to
trespass, or not to fish or hunt, and to keep off
the grass, or no admittance except on business
or something like that?" thought Uncle
Wiggily, as he put on his glasses to see if
there was any writing on the birch bark,
which animal folk use as we use paper. And
there was some writing on the bark. It read:</p>

<p>"Please do not jump in, or drink until I
come. Alice from Wonderland."</p>

<p>"Ha! That is strange," thought Uncle
Wiggily. "Alice must have been here and
put up that sign. But I wonder why she did
it? If she knew how warm and thirsty I was
she would not make me wait until she came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
get a drink. Perhaps it is all a joke, and not
her writing at all. One of the bad skillery-scalery
alligators or the fuzzy fox may have
put up the sign to fool me."</p>

<p>But when the rabbit gentleman took a second
look at the birch bark sign he saw that it
really was Alice's writing.</p>

<p>"Well, she must have some reason for it,"
said the bunny, with a sigh. "She dreamed
right about two fat boys&mdash;Tweedledum and
Tweedledee&mdash;saving me from the alligators,
so she must have some reason for asking me
to wait until she comes. But I am very
thirsty."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily sat down on the green,
mossy bank beside the spring of water and
looked at it. And it seemed so cool and wet,
and he was so thirsty, that it was all he could
do to keep from jumping in and having a
bath, as well as drinking all he wanted.</p>

<p>The sun grew hotter and more hot, and the
rabbit gentleman more and more thirsty, and
he didn't know what to do when, all of a sudden,
out from the bushes jumped a bad old
black bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" growled the bear. "I am just in
time, I see!" and he ran his red tongue over
his white teeth as though giving it a trolley
ride in a baby carriage.</p>

<p>"In time for what?" asked Uncle Wiggily,
casual like and make-believe indifferent.</p>

<p>"In time for lunch," answered the bear. "I
was afraid I'd be a little late. I hope I haven't
kept you waiting."</p>

<p>"For my lunch?" asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"No. For MINE!" and once more the bear
smacked his lips hungry like. "I am just in
time, I see."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you meant you were just in
time to take a drink of this water," said the
bunny, pointing at the pool. "If you did, you
aren't."</p>

<p>"If I did I aren't? What kind of talk is
that?" asked the bear, curious like.</p>

<p>"I mean we can't have a drink until Alice
comes&mdash;the sign says so," spoke Uncle Wiggily,
politely.</p>

<p>"Pooh! I don't believe in signs," snapped
the bear. "I'm thirsty and I'm going to have
a drink," and with that he took a long one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
from the woodland pool. And then a funny
thing happened.</p>

<p>The bear began to grow smaller and
smaller. First he was the size of a dog, then
of a cat, then of a kitten, then he shrank to
the littleness of a mouse, and next he was like
a June bug. Then he became a July bug,
next he was no larger than a little black ant,
and finally he became a microbe, and Uncle
Wiggily couldn't see him at all.</p>

<p>"Well, thank goodness he's gone!" said the
bunny. "But what made him so shrinking
like I wonder?"</p>

<p>"It was the pool of tears," said a voice behind
the bunny, and there stood Alice from
Wonderland. "This pool is sour alum water,
Uncle Wiggily," she said, "and if you drink it
you shrink and shrivel up and blow away.
That's why I put up the sign so nothing would
happen to you. I knew about the pool, as it's
in my story book. And now we can go have
some funny adventures."</p>

<p>And away they went over the hills and far
away and that bear was never seen again.
But if your cat doesn't catch the ice cream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
cone in the mosquito net and feed it to the
gold fish, I'll tell you more of Uncle Wiggily's
adventures in a little while. For the old gentleman
rabbit had many surprising things
happen to him. You may read about them in
another book to be called "Uncle Wiggily In
Fairyland," which tells of some of the Genii
and Gnomes of the Arabian Nights.</p>

<p>So, until I have that book ready for you,
I'll just wish you a Good-night and many,
many happy dreams!</p>
